<h1>Chained Exception Facility</h1>
<p>It is common for Java code to catch one exception and throw
another:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
try {
    ...
} catch(YourException e) {
    throw new MyException();
}
</pre>
<p>Unfortunately, the information contained in the "causative
exception" (<tt>YourException</tt> in the example above) is
generally lost, which greatly complicates debugging. Recognizing
this problem, developers sometimes build ad hoc mechanisms to allow
certain "wrapped exceptions" to contain a second exception. An
accessor is generally provided to extract the contained exception.
Such mechanisms are sometimes known as "exception chaining
facilities", as they allow arbitrary chains of exceptions to be
constructed when contained exceptions are, themselves, wrapped
exceptions.</p>
<p>There are many advantages to unifying all of these facilities.
Chief among them are: (1) We guarantee that anyone who wants to
record the fact that one exception caused another can do so,
regardless of what the exceptions are. (2) By providing a common
API to record the fact that one exception caused another, we ease
this task, making it more likely that programmers will take the
trouble to do it. (3) By providing a common API to access causative
exceptions, we greatly increase the likelihood that this
information will be made available to those who need it. In fact,
the proposed mechanism prints entire "causal chain" as part of the
standard stack backtrace, ensuring that preexisting programs will
provide this information with no additional effort on the part of
their authors.</p>
<p>To address these issues, we have added two new methods to
<tt>Throwable</tt>, <a href=
"../../../api/java/lang/Throwable.html#getCause--"><tt>getCause()</tt></a>
and <a href=
"../../../api/java/lang/Throwable.html#initCause-java.lang.Throwable-">
<tt>initCause(Throwable)</tt></a>, and two new constructors,
<a href=
"../../../api/java/lang/Throwable.html#Throwable-java.lang.Throwable-">
<tt>Throwable(Throwable)</tt></a> and <a href=
"../../../api/java/lang/Throwable.html#Throwable-java.lang.String-java.lang.Throwable-">
<tt>Throwable(String, Throwable)</tt></a>. Other "general purpose"
exception classes (like <a href=
"../../../api/java/lang/Exception.html"><tt>Exception</tt></a>,
<a href=
"../../../api/java/lang/RuntimeException.html"><tt>RunTimeException</tt></a>
and <a href="../../../api/java/lang/Error.html"><tt>Error</tt></a>)
have been similarly outfitted with <tt>(Throwable)</tt> and
<tt>(String,&nbsp;Throwable</tt>) constructors. However, even
exceptions without such constructors will be usable as "wrapped
exceptions" via the <tt>initCause</tt> method.</p>
<p>The implementation of <a href=
"../../../api/java/lang/Throwable.html#printStackTrace--"><tt>Throwable.printStackTrace</tt></a>
has been modified to display backtraces for the entire causal chain
of exceptions. New method <tt><a href=
"../../../api/java/lang/Throwable.html#getStackTrace--">getStackTrace</a></tt>
provides programmatic access to the stack trace information
provided by <tt>printStackTrace</tt>.</p>
<p>All of the platform's wrapped exceptions will be retrofitted to
support the new facility (in addition to their legacy APIs).</p>
