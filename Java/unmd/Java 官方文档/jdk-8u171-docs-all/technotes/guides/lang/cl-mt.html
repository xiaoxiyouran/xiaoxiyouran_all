<h1>Multithreaded Custom Class Loaders in Java</h1>
<p>The Java SE 7 release contains an important enhancement for
multithreaded custom class loaders. In previous releases, certain
types of custom class loaders were prone to deadlock. The Java SE 7
release modifies the locking mechanism to avoid deadlock.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>The function of a <code>java.lang.ClassLoader</code> is to
locate the bytecode for a particular class, then transform that
bytecode into a usable class in the runtime system. The runtime
system provides class loaders that can locate bootstrap classes,
extension classes, and user classes. The <code>CLASSPATH</code>
environment variable is one way to indicate to the runtime system
where the bytecode is located.</p>
<p>Knowing about the <code>CLASSPATH</code> environment variable is
all you may need to know about class loading. In some specific
situations, however, customizing the behavior of a class loader by
creating your own subclass may be necessary.</p>
<p>Custom class loaders will not run into deadlocks if they adhere
to an acyclic class loader delegation model. Acyclic delegation is
what the architects of <code>ClassLoader</code> envisioned. In this
model, every class loader has a parent (delegate). When a class is
requested, the class loader first checks if the class was loaded
previously. If the class is not found, the class loader asks its
parent to locate the class. If the parent cannot find the class,
the class loader attempts to locate the class itself.</p>
<h2>Deadlock Scenario</h2>
<p>In earlier releases of the Java platform, multithreaded custom
class loaders could deadlock when they did not have an acyclic
delegation model. Here is one example:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
Class Hierarchy:
  class A extends B
  class C extends D

ClassLoader Delegation Hierarchy:

Custom Classloader CL1:
  directly loads class A 
  delegates to custom ClassLoader CL2 for class B

Custom Classloader CL2:
  directly loads class C
  delegates to custom ClassLoader CL1 for class D

Thread 1:
  Use CL1 to load class A (locks CL1)
    defineClass A triggers
      loadClass B (try to lock CL2)

Thread 2:
  Use CL2 to load class C (locks CL2)
    defineClass C triggers
      loadClass D (try to lock CL1)
</pre>
<p>Synchronization in the <code>ClassLoader</code> class was
previously heavy-handed, or in technical terms, <i>not sufficiently
granular</i>. A request to load a class synchronized on the entire
<code>ClassLoader</code> object, which made it prone to
deadlock.</p>
<h2>Class Loader Synchronization in the Java SE 7 Release</h2>
<p>The Java SE 7 release includes the concept of a <i>parallel
capable</i> class loader. Loading a class by a parallel capable
class loader now synchronizes on the pair consisting of the class
loader and the class name.</p>
<p>In the previous scenario, using the Java SE 7 release, the
threads are no longer deadlocked, and all classes are loaded
successfully:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
Thread 1:
  Use CL1 to load class A (locks CL1+A)
    defineClass A triggers
      loadClass B (locks CL2+B)

Thread 2:
  Use CL2 to load class C (locks CL2+C)
    defineClass C triggers
      loadClass D (locks CL1+D)
</pre>
<h2>Recommendations for Multithreaded Custom Class Loaders</h2>
<p>Custom class loaders that do not have a history of deadlocks do
not require any changes. In particular, you do not need to change
custom class loaders that follow the recommended acyclic
hierarchical delegation model, that is, delegating first to their
parent class. For backward compatibility, the Java SE 7 release
continues to lock a class loader object unless it registers as
parallel capable.</p>
<p>To create new custom class loaders, the process is similar in
the Java SE 7 release as in previous releases. Create a subclass of
<code>ClassLoader</code>, then override the
<code>findClass()</code> method and possibly
<code>loadClass()</code>. Overriding <code>loadClass()</code> makes
your life more difficult, but it is the only way to use a different
delegation model.</p>
<p>If you have a custom class loader with a risk of deadlocking,
with the Java SE 7 release, you can avoid deadlocks by following
these rules:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ensure that your custom class loader is multithread safe for
concurrent class loading.
<ol type="a">
<li>Decide upon an internal locking scheme. For example,
<code>java.lang.ClassLoader</code> uses a locking scheme based on
the requested class name.</li>
<li>Remove all synchronization on the class loader object lock
alone.</li>
<li>Ensure that critical sections are safe for multiple threads
loading different classes.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>In your custom class loader's static initializer, invoke
<code>java.lang.ClassLoader</code>'s static method
<code>registerAsParallelCapable()</code>. This registration
indicates that all instances of your custom class loader are
multithread safe.</li>
<li>Check that all class loader classes that this custom class
loader extends also invoke the
<code>registerAsParallelCapable()</code> method in their class
initializers. Ensure that they are multithread safe for concurrent
class loading.</li>
</ol>
<p>If your custom class loader overrides only
<code>findClass(String)</code>, you do not need further changes.
This is the recommended mechanism to create a custom class
loader.</p>
<p>If your custom class loader overrides either the <code>protected
loadClass(String, boolean)</code> method or the <code>public
loadClass(String)</code> method, you must also ensure that the
protected <code>defineClass()</code> method is called only once for
each class loader and class name pair.</p>
<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
<p>If your product ships and appears to have problems due to
incomplete handling of critical sections, you can use a new VM flag
<code>-XX:+AlwaysLockClassLoader</code>. This flag reverts to
locking the class loader lock before invoking your custom class
loader's <code>findClass()</code> or <code>loadClass()</code>
method, even for class loaders that register as parallel
capable.</p>
