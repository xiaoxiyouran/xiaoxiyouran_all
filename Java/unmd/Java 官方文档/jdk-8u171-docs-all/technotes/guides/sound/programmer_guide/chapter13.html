<h2><a name="what" id="what"></a>What Are Services?</h2>
<p>Services are units of sound-handling functionality that are
automatically available when an application program makes use of an
implementation of the Java Sound API. They consist of objects that
do the work of reading, writing, mixing, processing, and converting
audio and MIDI data. An implementation of the Java Sound API
generally supplies a basic set of services, but mechanisms are also
included in the API to support the development of new sound
services by third-party developers (or by the vendor of the
implementation itself). These new services can be "plugged into" an
existing installed implementation to expand its functionality
without requiring a new release. In the Java Sound API
architecture, third-party services are integrated into the system
in such a way that an application program's interface to them is
the same as the interface to the "built-in" services. In some
cases, application developers who use the
<code>javax.sound.sampled</code> and <code>javax.sound.midi</code>
packages might not even be aware that they are employing
third-party services.</p>
<p>Examples of potential third-party, sampled-audio services
include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sound file readers and writers</li>
<li>Converters that translate between different audio data
formats</li>
<li>New audio mixers and input/output devices, whether implemented
purely in software, or in hardware with a software interface</li>
</ul>
Third-party MIDI services might consist of:
<ul>
<li>MIDI file readers and writers</li>
<li>Readers for various types of soundbank files (which are often
specific to particular synthesizers)</li>
<li>MIDI-controlled sound synthesizers, sequencers, and I/O ports,
whether implemented purely in software, or in hardware with a
software interface</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="how" id="how"></a>How Services Work</h2>
<p>The <code>javax.sound.sampled</code> and
<code>javax.sound.midi</code> packages provide functionality to
application developers who wish to include sound services in their
application programs. These packages are for <em>consumers</em> of
sound services, providing interfaces to get information about,
control, and access audio and MIDI services. In addition, the Java
Sound API also supplies two packages that define abstract classes
to be used by <em>providers</em> of sound services: the
<code>javax.sound.sampled.spi</code> and
<code>javax.sound.midi.spi</code> packages.</p>
<p>Developers of new sound services implement concrete subclasses
of the appropriate classes in the SPI packages. These subclasses,
along with any additional classes required to support the new
service, are placed in a Java
Archive (JAR) archive file with a description of the included
service or services. When this JAR file is installed in the user's
<code>CLASSPATH</code>, the runtime system automatically makes the
new service available, extending the functionality of the
Java platform's runtime system.</p>
<p>Once the new service is installed, it can be accessed just like
any previously installed service. Consumers of services can get
information about the new service, or obtain instances of the new
service class itself, by invoking methods of the
<code>AudioSystem</code> and <code>MidiSystem</code> classes (in
the <code>javax.sound.sampled</code> and
<code>javax.sound.midi</code> packages, respectively) to return
information about the new services, or to return instances of new
or existing service classes themselves. Application programs need
not&mdash;and should not&mdash;reference the classes in the SPI
packages (and their subclasses) directly to make use of the
installed services.</p>
<p>For example, suppose a hypothetical service provider called Acme
Software, Inc. is interested in supplying a package that allows
application programs to read a new format of sound file (but one
whose audio data is in a standard data format). The SPI class
<code>AudioFileReader</code> can be subclassed into a class called,
say, <code>AcmeAudioFileReader</code>. In the new subclass, Acme
would supply implementations of all the methods defined in
<code>AudioFileReader</code>; in this case there are only two
methods (with argument variants), <code>getAudioFileFormat</code>
and <code>getAudioInputStream</code>. Then when an application
program attempted to read a sound file that happened to be in
Acme's file format, it would invoke methods of the
<code>AudioSystem</code> class in <code>javax.sound.sampled</code>
to access the file and information about it. The methods
<code>AudioSystem.getAudioInputStream</code> and
<code>AudioSystem.getAudioFileFormat</code> provide a standard API
to read audio streams; with the <code>AcmeAudioFileReader</code>
class installed, this interface is extended to support the new file
type transparently. Application developers don't need direct access
to the newly registered SPI classes: the <code>AudioSystem</code>
object methods pass the query on to the installed
<code>AcmeAudioFileReader</code> class.</p>
<p>What's the point of having these "factory" classes? Why not
permit the application developer to get access directly to newly
provided services? That is a possible approach, but having all
management and instantiation of services pass through gatekeeper
system objects shields the application developer from having to
know anything about the identity of installed services. Application
developers just use services of value to them, perhaps without even
realizing it. At the same time this architecture permits service
providers to effectively manage the available resources in their
packages.</p>
<p>Often the use of new sound services is transparent to the
application program. For example, imagine a situation where an
application developer wants to read in a stream of audio from a
file. Assuming that <code>thePathName</code> identifies an audio
input file, the program does this:</p>
<pre>
    File theInFile = new File(thePathName);
    AudioInputStream theInStream = AudioSystem.getAudioInputStream(theInFile); 
</pre>
Behind the scenes, the <code>AudioSystem</code> determines what
installed service can read the file and asks it to supply the audio
data as an <code>AudioInputStream</code> object. The developer
might not know or even care that the input audio file is in some
new file format (such as Acme's), supported by installed
third-party services. The program's first contact with the stream
is through the <code>AudioSystem</code> object, and all its
subsequent access to the stream and its properties are through the
methods of <code>AudioInputStream</code>. Both of these are
standard objects in the <code>javax.sound.sampled</code> API; the
special handling that the new file format may require is completely
hidden.
<h2><a name="how_providers" id="how_providers"></a>How Providers
Prepare New Services</h2>
<p>Service providers supply their new services in specially
formatted JAR files, which are to be installed in a directory on
the user's system where the Java runtime will find them. JAR files
are archive files, each containing sets of files that might be
organized in hierarchical directory structures within the archive.
Details about the preparation of the class files that go into these
archives are discussed in Chapters 14 and 15, which describe the
specifics of the audio and MIDI SPI packages; here we'll just give
an overview of the process of JAR file creation.</p>
<p>The JAR file for a new service or services should contain a
class file for each service supported in the JAR file. Following
the Java platform's convention, each class file has the name of the
newly defined class, which is a concrete subclass of one of the
abstract service provider classes. The JAR file also must include
any supporting classes required by the new service implementation.
So that the new service or services can be located by the runtime
system's service provider mechanism, the JAR file must also contain
special files (described below) that map the SPI class names to the
new subclasses being defined.</p>
<p>To continue from our example above, say Acme Software, Inc. is
distributing a package of new sampled-audio services. Let's suppose
this package consists of two new services:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>AcmeAudioFileReader</code> class, which was mentioned
above, and which is a subclass of <code>AudioFileReader</code></li>
<li>A subclass of <code>AudioFileWriter</code> called
<code>AcmeAudioFileWriter</code>, which will write sound files in
Acme's new format</li>
</ul>
Starting from an arbitrary directory&mdash;let's call it
<code>/devel</code>&mdash;where we want to do the build, we create
subdirectories and put the new class files in them, organized in
such a manner as to give the desired pathname by which the new
classes will be referenced:
<pre>
    com/acme/AcmeAudioFileReader.class
    com/acme/AcmeAudioFileWriter.class
</pre>
In addition, for each new SPI class being subclassed, we create a
mapping file in a specially named directory
<code>META-INF/services</code>. The name of the file is the name of
the SPI class being subclassed, and the file contains the names of
the new subclasses of that SPI abstract class.
<p>We create the file</p>
<p>
<code>META-INF/services/javax.sound.sampled.spi.AudioFileReader</code>,
which consists of</p>
<pre>
    # Providers of sound file-reading services 
    # (a comment line begins with a pound sign)
    com.acme.AcmeAudioFileReader
</pre>
<p>and also the file</p>
<p>
<code>META-INF/services/javax.sound.sampled.spi.AudioFileWriter,</code>
which consists of</p>
<pre>
   # Providers of sound file-writing services 
    com.acme.AcmeAudioFileWriter
</pre>
<p>Now we run <code>jar</code> from any directory with the command
line:</p>
<pre>
jar cvf acme.jar -C /devel .
</pre>
The <code>-C</code> option causes <code>jar</code> to switch to the
<code>/devel</code> directory, instead of using the directory in
which the command is executed. The final period argument instructs
<code>jar</code> to archive all the contents of that directory
(namely, <code>/devel</code>), but not the directory itself.
<p>This run will create the file <code>acme.jar</code> with the
contents:</p>
<pre>
com/acme/AcmeAudioFileReader.class
com/acme/AcmeAudioFileWriter.class
META-INF/services/javax.sound.sampled.spi.AudioFileReader
META-INF/services/javax.sound.sampled.spi.AudioFileWriter
META-INF/Manifest.mf
</pre>
The file <code>Manifest.mf,</code> which is generated by the
<code>jar</code> utility itself, is a list of all the files
contained in the archive.
<h2><a name="how_users" id="how_users"></a>How Users Install New
Services</h2>
<p>For end users (or system administrators) who wish to get access
to a new service through their application programs, installation
is simple. They place the provided JAR file in a directory in their
<code>CLASSPATH.</code> Upon execution, the Java runtime will find
the referenced classes when needed.</p>
<p>It's not an error to install more than one provider for the same
service. For example, two different service providers might supply
support for reading the same type of sound file. In such a case,
the system arbitrarily chooses one of the providers. Users who care
which provider is chosen should install only the desired one.</p>
