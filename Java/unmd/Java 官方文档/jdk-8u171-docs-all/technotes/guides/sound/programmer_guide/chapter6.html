<h1>Chapter 6: Processing Audio with Controls</h1>
<p><a name="a114170" id="a114170"></a> Previous chapters have
discussed how to play or capture audio samples. The implicit goal
has been to deliver samples as faithfully as possible, without
modification (other than possibly mixing the samples with those
from other audio lines). Sometimes, however, you want to be able to
modify the signal. The user might want it to sound louder, quieter,
fuller, more reverberant, higher or lower in pitch, and so on. This
chapter discusses the Java Sound API features that provide these
kinds of signal processing.</p>
<p><a name="a114172" id="a114172"></a> There are two ways to apply
signal processing:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style: none"><a name="a114174" id=
"a114174"></a></li>
<li>You can use any processing supported by the mixer or its
component lines, by querying for <code>Control</code> objects and
then setting the controls as the user desires. Typical controls
supported by mixers and lines include gain, pan, and reverberation
controls. <a name="a114175" id="a114175"></a></li>
<li>If the kind of processing you need isn't provided by the mixer
or its lines, your program can operate directly on the audio bytes,
manipulating them as desired.
<p><a name="a114177" id="a114177"></a></p>
</li>
</ul>
This chapter discusses the first technique in greater detail,
because there is no special API for the second technique. <a name=
"a114180"></a>
<h2>Introduction to Controls</h2>
<p><a name="a114182" id="a114182"></a> A mixer can have various
sorts of signal-processing controls on some or all of its lines.
For example, a mixer used for audio capture might have an input
port with a gain control, and target data lines with gain and pan
controls. A mixer used for audio playback might have sample-rate
controls on its source data lines. In each case, the controls are
all accessed through methods of the <code>Line</code>
interface.</p>
<p><a name="a114185" id="a114185"></a> Because the
<code>Mixer</code> interface extends <code>Line</code>, the mixer
itself can have its own set of controls. These might serve as
master controls affecting all the mixer's source or target lines.
For example, the mixer might have a master gain control whose value
in decibels is added to the values of individual gain controls on
its target lines.</p>
<p><a name="a115789" id="a115789"></a> Others of the mixer's own
controls might affect a special line, neither a source nor a
target, that the mixer uses internally for its processing. For
example, a global reverb control might choose the sort of
reverberation to apply to a mixture of the input signals, and this
"wet" (reverberated) signal would get mixed back into the "dry"
signal before delivery to the mixer's target lines.</p>
<p><a name="a114187" id="a114187"></a> If the mixer or any of its
lines have controls, you might wish to expose the controls via
graphical objects in your program's user interface, so that the
user can adjust the audio characteristics as desired. The controls
are not themselves graphical; they just allow you to retrieve and
change their settings. It's up to you to decide what sort of
graphical representations (sliders, buttons, etc.), if any, to use
in your program.</p>
<p><a name="a114189" id="a114189"></a> All controls are implemented
as concrete subclasses of the abstract class <code>Control</code>.
Many typical audio-processing controls can be described by abstract
subclasses of <code>Control</code> based on a data type (such as
boolean, enumerated, or float). Boolean controls, for example,
represent binary-state controls, such as on/off controls for mute
or reverb. Float controls, on the other hand, are well suited to
represent continuously variable controls, such as pan, balance, or
volume.</p>
<p><a name="a114191" id="a114191"></a> The Java Sound API specifies
the following abstract subclasses of <code>Control</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style: none"><a name="a114193" id=
"a114193"></a></li>
<li><code>BooleanControl</code>&mdash;represents a binary-state
(true or false) control. For example, mute, solo, and on/off
switches would be good candidates for <code>BooleanControls</code>.
<a name="a114194" id="a114194"></a></li>
<li><code>FloatControl</code>&mdash;data model providing control
over a range of floating-point values. For example, volume and pan
are <code>FloatControls</code> that could be manipulated via a dial
or slider. <a name="a114195" id="a114195"></a></li>
<li><code>EnumControl</code>&mdash;offers a choice from a set of
objects. For example, you might associate a set of buttons in the
user interface with an <code>EnumControl</code> to select one of
several preset reverberation settings. <a name="a114196" id=
"a114196"></a></li>
<li><code>CompoundControl</code>&mdash;provides access to a
collection of related items, each of which is itself an instance of
a <code>Control</code> subclass. <code>CompoundControls</code>
represent multi-control modules such as graphic equalizers. (A
graphic equalizer would typically be depicted by a set of sliders,
each affecting a <code>FloatControl</code>.)
<p><a name="a114198" id="a114198"></a></p>
</li>
</ul>
Each subclass of <code>Control</code> above has methods appropriate
for its underlying data type. Most of the classes include methods
that set and get the control's current value(s), get the control's
label(s), and so on.
<p><a name="a115790" id="a115790"></a> Of course, each class has
methods that are particular to it and the data model represented by
the class. For example, <code>EnumControl</code> has a method that
lets you get the set of its possible values, and
<code>FloatControl</code> permits you to get its minimum and
maximum values, as well as the precision (increment or step size)
of the control.</p>
<p><a name="a114976" id="a114976"></a> Each subclass of
<code>Control</code> has a corresponding <code>Control.Type</code>
subclass, which includes static instances that identify specific
controls.</p>
<p><a name="a115785" id="a115785"></a> The following table shows
each <code>Control</code> subclass, its corresponding
<code>Control.Type</code> subclass, and the static instances that
indicate specific kinds of controls:</p>

<p><a name="a115029" id="a115029"></a></p>
<p><a name="a117861" id="a117861"></a> An implementation of the
Java Sound API can provide any or all of these control types on its
mixers and lines. It can also supply additional control types not
defined in the Java Sound API. Such control types could be
implemented via concrete subclasses of any of these four abstract
subclasses, or via additional <code>Control</code> subclasses that
don't inherit from any of these four abstract subclasses. An
application program can query each line to find what controls it
supports.</p>
<a name="a117862" id="a117862"></a>
<h2>Getting a Line that Has the Desired Controls</h2>
<p><a name="a114235" id="a114235"></a> In many cases, an
application program will simply display whatever controls happen to
be supported by the line in question. If the line doesn't have any
controls, so be it. But what if it's important to find a line that
has certain controls? In that case, you can use a
<code>Line.Info</code> to obtain a line that has the right
characteristics, as described under "<a href=
"chapter3.html#a113154">Getting a Line of a Desired Type</a>" in
Chapter 3, "<a href="chapter3.html">Accessing Audio System
Resources</a>."</p>
<p><a name="a114237" id="a114237"></a> For example, suppose you
prefer an input port that lets the user set the volume of the sound
input. The following code excerpt shows how one might query the
default mixer to determine whether it has the desired port and
control:</p>
<pre>
<code>Port lineIn;
</code><code>FloatControl volCtrl;
</code><code>try {
</code><code>  mixer = AudioSystem.getMixer(null);
</code><code>  </code>lineIn = (Port)mixer.getLine(Port.Info.LINE_IN);
<code>  lineIn.open();
</code><code>  volCtrl = (FloatControl) lineIn.getControl(<br />      FloatControl.Type.VOLUME);
</code><code>  // Assuming getControl call succeeds, 
</code><code>  // we now have our LINE_IN VOLUME control.
</code><code>} catch (Exception e) {
</code><code>  System.out.println("Failed trying to find LINE_IN"
</code><code>    + " VOLUME control: exception = " + e);
</code><code>}
</code><code>if (volCtrl != null)
</code><code>  // ...
</code>
</pre>
<a name="a114255" id="a114255"></a>
<h2>Getting the Controls from the Line</h2>
<p><a name="a114257" id="a114257"></a> An application program that
needs to expose controls in its user interface might simply query
the available lines and controls, and then display an appropriate
user-interface element for every control on every line of interest.
In such a case, the program's only mission is to provide the user
with "handles" on the control; not to know what those controls do
to the audio signal. As long as the program knows how to map a
line's controls into user-interface elements, the Java Sound API
architecture of <code>Mixer</code>, <code>Line</code>, and
<code>Control</code> will generally take care of the rest.</p>
<p><a name="a117125" id="a117125"></a> For example, suppose your
program plays back sound. You're using a
<code>SourceDataLine</code>, which you've obtained as described
under "<a href="chapter3.html#a113154">Getting a Line of a Desired
Type</a>" in Chapter 3, "<a href="chapter3.html">Accessing Audio
System Resources</a>." You can access the line's controls by
invoking the <code>Line</code> method:</p>
<pre>
Control[] getControls()
</pre>
Then, for each of the controls in this returned array, you then use
the following <code>Control</code> method to get the control's
type:
<pre>
Control.Type getType()
</pre>
Knowing the specific <code>Control.Type</code> instance, your
program can display a corresponding user-interface element. Of
course, choosing "a corresponding user-interface element" for a
specific <code>Control.Type</code> depends on the approach taken by
your program. On the one hand, you might use the same kind of
element to represent all <code>Control.Type</code> instances of the
same class. This would require you to query the <em>class</em> of
the <code>Control.Type</code> instance using, for example, the
<code>Object.getClass</code> method. Let's say the result matched
<code>BooleanControl.Type</code>. In this case, your program might
display a generic checkbox or toggle button, but if its class
matched <code>FloatControl.Type</code>, then you might display a
graphic slider.
<p><a name="a116400" id="a116400"></a> On the other hand, your
program might distinguish between different types of
controls&mdash;even those of the same class&mdash;and use a
different user-interface element for each one. This would require
you to test the <em>instance</em> returned by <code>Control's
getType</code> method. Then if, for example, the type matched
<code>BooleanControl.Type.APPLY_REVERB</code>, your program might
display a checkbox; while if the type matched
<code>BooleanControl.Type.MUTE</code>, you might instead display a
toggle button.</p>

<h2>Using a Control to Change the Audio Signal</h2>
<table summary="" width="80%" align="center" cellpadding="5">
<tr>
<td><b>Note</b>
<p>The current implementation requires that to change the value of
a <code>Control</code> its corresponding <code>Line</code> must be
open.<br /></p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p><a name="a116402" id="a116402"></a> Now that you know how to
access a control and determine its type, this section will describe
how to use <code>Controls</code> to change aspects of the audio
signal. This section doesn't cover every available control; rather,
it provides a few examples in this area to show you how to get
started. These example include:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style: none"><a name="a114276" id=
"a114276"></a></li>
<li>Controlling a line's mute state <a name="a114277" id=
"a114277"></a></li>
<li>Changing a line's volume <a name="a114278" id=
"a114278"></a></li>
<li>Selecting among various reverberation presets
<p><a name="a114280" id="a114280"></a></p>
</li>
</ul>
Suppose that your program has accessed all of its mixers, their
lines and the controls on those lines, and that it has a data
structure to manage the logical associations between the controls
and their corresponding user-interface elements. Then, translating
the user's manipulations of those controls into the corresponding
<code>Control</code> methods becomes a fairly straightforward
matter.
<p><a name="a114282" id="a114282"></a> The following subsections
describe some of the methods that must be invoked to affect the
changes to specific controls.</p>
<a name="a114284" id="a114284"></a>
<h3>Controlling a Line's Mute State</h3>
<p><a name="a114286" id="a114286"></a> Controlling the mute state
of any line is simply a matter of calling the following
<code>BooleanControl</code> method:</p>
<pre>
void setValue(boolean value)
</pre>
(Presumably, the program knows, by referring to its
control-management data structures, that the mute is an instance of
a <code>BooleanControl</code>.) To mute the signal that's passing
through the line, the program invokes the method above, specifying
<code>true</code> as the value. To turn muting off, permitting the
signal to flow through the line, the program invokes the method
with the parameter set to <code>false</code>. <a name="a114292" id=
"a114292"></a>
<h3>Changing a Line's Volume</h3>
<p><a name="a114294" id="a114294"></a> Let's assume your program
associates a particular graphic slider with a particular line's
volume control. The value of a volume control (i.e.,
<code>FloatControl.Type.VOLUME</code>) is set using the following
<code>FloatControl</code> method:</p>
<pre>
void setValue(float newValue)
</pre>
Detecting that the user moved the slider, the program gets the
slider's current value and passes it, as the parameter
<code>newValue</code>, to the method above. This changes the volume
of the signal flowing though the line that "owns" the control.
<a name="a114300" id="a114300"></a>
<h3>Selecting among Various Reverberation Presets</h3>
<p><a name="a114302" id="a114302"></a> Let's suppose that our
program has a mixer with a line that has a control of type
<code>EnumControl.Type.REVERB</code>. Calling the
<code>EnumControl</code> method:</p>
<pre>
java.lang.Objects[] getValues() 
</pre>
on that control produces an array of <code>ReverbType</code>
objects. If desired, the particular parameter settings of each of
these objects can be accessed using the following
<code>ReverbType</code> methods:
<pre>
int getDecayTime() 
int getEarlyReflectionDelay() 
float getEarlyReflectionIntensity() 
int getLateReflectionDelay() 
float getLateReflectionIntensity() 
</pre>
For example, if a program only wants a single reverb setting that
sounds like a cavern, it can iterate over the
<code>ReverbType</code> objects until it finds one for which
<code>getDecayTime</code> returns a value greater than 2000. For a
thorough explanation of these methods, including a table of
representative return values, see the API reference documentation
for <code>javax.sound.sampled.ReverbType</code>.
<p><a name="a114316" id="a114316"></a> Typically, though, a program
will create a user-interface element, for example, a radio button,
for each of the <code>ReverbType</code> objects within the array
returned by the <code>getValues</code> method. When the user clicks
on one of these radio buttons, the program invokes the
<code>EnumControl</code> method</p>
<pre>
void setValue(java.lang.Object value) 
</pre>
where <code>value</code> is set to the <code>ReverbType</code> that
corresponds to the newly engaged button. The audio signal sent
through the line that "owns" this <code>EnumControl</code> will
then be reverberated according to the parameter settings that
constitute the control's current <code>ReverbType</code> (i.e., the
particular <code>ReverbType</code> specified in the
<code>value</code> argument of the <code>setValue</code> method).
<p><a name="a114323" id="a114323"></a> So, from our application
program's perspective, enabling a user to move from one
reverberation preset (i.e., ReverbType) to another is simply a
matter of connecting each element of the array returned by
<code>getValues</code> to a distinct radio button.</p>
<a name="a114326" id="a114326"></a>
<h2>Manipulating the Audio Data Directly</h2>
<p><a name="a114328" id="a114328"></a> The <code>Control</code> API
allows an implementation of the Java Sound API, or a third-party
provider of a mixer, to supply arbitrary sorts of signal processing
through controls. But what if no mixer offers the kind of signal
processing you need? It will take more work, but you might be able
to implement the signal processing in your program. Because the
Java Sound API gives you access to the audio data as an array of
bytes, you can alter these bytes in any way you choose.</p>
<p><a name="a114330" id="a114330"></a> If you're processing
incoming sound, you can read the bytes from a
<code>TargetDataLine</code> and then manipulate them. An
algorithmically trivial example that can yield sonically intriguing
results is to play a sound backwards by arranging its frames in
reverse order. This trivial example may not be of much use for your
program, but there are numerous sophisticated digital signal
processing (DSP) techniques that might be more appropriate. Some
examples are equalization, dynamic-range compression, peak
limiting, and time stretching or compression, as well as special
effects such as delay, chorus, flanging, distortion, and so on.</p>
<p><a name="a114332" id="a114332"></a> To play back processed
sound, you can place your manipulated array of bytes into a
<code>SourceDataLine</code> or <code>Clip</code>. Of course, the
array of bytes need not be derived from an existing sound. You can
synthesize sounds from scratch, although this requires some
knowledge of acoustics or else access to sound-synthesis functions.
For either processing or synthesis, you may want to consult an
audio DSP textbook for the algorithms in which you're interested,
or else import a third-party library of signal-processing functions
into your program. For playback of synthesized sound, consider
whether the <code>Synthesizer</code> API in the
<code>javax.sound.midi</code> package meets your needs instead.

Sound</a>.")</p>
