<h2 align="center">Sound Architecture Overview</h2>
<h3>Design Goals</h3>
<p>The Java Sound API is a low-level API for effecting and
controlling input and output of audio media. It provides explicit
control over the capabilities commonly required for audio input and
output in a framework that promotes extensibility and
flexibility.</p>
<p>Because sound is so fundamental, Java Sound fulfills the needs
of a wide range of customers. Potential application areas
include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Communication frameworks, such as conferencing and
telephony</li>
<li>End-user content delivery systems, such as media players and
music using streamed content</li>
<li>Interactive applications, such as games and Web sites that use
dynamic content</li>
<li>Content creation and editing</li>
<li>Tools, toolkits, and utilities<br /></li>
</ul>
<p>Java Sound enables applications to extend audio support with
specialized capabilities, and integrates well with architectures
that provide higher-level interfaces and integration with other
media types.</p>
<p>Java Sound provides the lowest level of audio support on the
Java platform. It provides a high degree of control over
audio-specific functionality. For example, it provides mechanisms
for installing, accessing, and manipulating system resources such
as digital audio and MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface)
devices. It does not include sophisticated sound editors and GUI
tools; rather, it provides a set of capabilities upon which such
applications can be built. It emphasizes low-level control beyond
that commonly expected by the end user, who benefits from
higher-level interfaces built on top of Java Sound.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> Throughout this document, the word "application"
refers generically to Java applets as well as Java
applications.</p>
&nbsp;
<h3>Packages</h3>
<p>The Java Sound API includes support for both digital audio and
MIDI data. These two major modules of functionality are provided in
separate packages:</p>
<div style="margin-left: 2em">
<p><tt>javax.sound.sampled</tt><br />
This package specifies interfaces for capture, mixing, and playback
of digital (sampled) audio.</p>
<p><tt>javax.sound.midi</tt><br />
This package provides interfaces for MIDI synthesis, sequencing,
and event transport.</p>
</div>
<p>Two other packages permit service providers (as opposed to
application developers) to create custom components that can be
installed on the system:</p>
<div style="margin-left: 2em"><tt>javax.sound.sampled.spi<br />
javax.sound.midi.spi</tt><br /></div>
<p>The next section of this document discusses the sampled-audio
system, including an overview of the <tt>javax.sound.sampled</tt>
API. The final section covers the MIDI system and the
<tt>javax.sound.midi</tt> API.</p>
&nbsp;
<h3>Sampled Audio</h3>
<p>The <tt>javax.sound.sampled</tt> package handles digital audio
data, also referred to as sampled audio. (&quot;Samples&quot; refer
to successive snapshots of a signal, which in the case of digital
audio is a sound wave. For example, the audio recorded for storage
on compact discs is sampled 44100 times per second. Typically,
sampled audio comes from a sound recording, but the sound could
instead be synthetically generated. The term &quot;sampled
audio&quot; refers to the type of data, not its origin. Sampled
audio can be thought of as the sound itself, whereas MIDI data can
be thought of as a recipe for creating musical sound.)</p>
<p>Java Sound does not assume a specific audio hardware
configuration; it is designed to allow different sorts of audio
components to be installed on a system and accessed by the API.
Java Sound supports common functionality such as input and output
from a sound card (for example, for recording and playback of sound
files) as well as mixing of multiple streams of audio. Here is one
example of a typical audio architecture for which Java Sound might
be used:<br /></p>
<div style="margin-left: 2em">
<p align="center"><img src="Figures/typicalAudioArch.gif" alt=
"The logic flows from the input device to the software mixer and finaly to the output device. Each device has various input and output ports."
width="413" height="251" /></p>
<em>A Typical Audio Architecture</em>
</div>
<p>In this example, a device such as a sound card has various input
and output ports, and mixing is provided in software. The MIDI
synthesizer shown as one of the mixer???s audio inputs might also be
a feature of the sound card, or it might be implemented in
software. (The <tt>javax.sound.midi</tt> package, discussed later,
supplies a Java interface for synthesizers.)</p>
<p>The major concepts used in the <tt>javax.sound.sampled</tt>
package are described in the sections below.</p>
<div style="margin-left: 2em"><br />
<h4>Lines</h4>
<p>A line is an element of the digital audio "pipeline," such as an
audio input or output port, a mixer, or an audio data path into or
out of a mixer. The audio data flowing through a line can be mono
or multichannel (for example, stereo). Each type of line will be
described shortly, but first some of their functional relationships
will be illustrated, showing the flow of audio through the
"pipeline." The following diagram shows different types of lines in
a simple audio-output system:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="Figures/audioOutput.GIF" alt=
"The following context describes this graphic." width="380" height=
"100" /></p>
<em>A Possible Configuration of Lines for Audio
Output</em>
<p>In this example, an application has asked a mixer for one or
more available clips and source data lines. A clip is a mixer input
into which you can load audio data prior to playback; a source data
line is a mixer input that accepts a real-time stream of audio
data. The application preloads audio data from a sound file into
the clips, and then pushes other audio data into the source data
lines. The mixer reads data from these lines, each of which may
have its own reverberation, gain, and pan controls, and uses the
reverb settings to mix the &quot;dry&quot; audio signals with the
reverberated (&quot;wet&quot;) mix. The mixer delivers its final
output to one or more output ports, such as a speaker, a headphone
jack, and a line-out jack.</p>
<p>Although the various lines are depicted as separate rectangles
in the diagram, they are all "owned" by the mixer, and can be
considered integral parts of the mixer. The reverb, gain, and pan
rectangles represent processing controls (rather than lines) that
can be applied by the mixer to data flowing through the lines.
(Note that this is just one example of a possible audio system that
is supported by the API. Not all audio configurations will have all
the features illustrated. An individual source data line might not
support panning, a mixer might not implement reverb, and so
on.)</p>
<p>A simple audio-input system might be similar:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="Figures/audioInput.GIF" alt=
"The following context describes this graphic." width="291" height=
"90" /></p>
<em>A Possible Configuration of Lines for Audio
Input</em>
<p>Here, data flows in to the mixer from one or more input ports,
commonly the microphone or the line-in jack. Gain and pan are
applied, and the mixer delivers the captured data to an application
via the mixer's target data line. A target data line is a mixer
output, containing the mixture of the streamed input sounds. The
simplest mixer has just one target data line, but some mixers can
deliver captured data to multiple target data lines
simultaneously.</p>
The different types of line will now be examined more closely.
Several types of line are defined by subinterfaces of the basic
<code>Line</code> interface. The interface hierarchy is shown
below.
<p align="center"><img src="Figures/lineInterfaces.GIF" alt=
"See long description" longdesc="arch_overview.txt" width="402"
height="211" /><a href="arch_overview.txt" name=
"Long__description__for" id="Long__description__for">[D]</a></p>
<em>The Line Interface Hierarchy</em>
<p>The base interface, <b><code>Line</code></b>, describes the
minimal functionality common to all lines:</p>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 2em">
<ul>
<li>Routing<br />
<br />
A line has an information object (an instance of
<code>Line.Info</code>) that indicates what mixer (if any) sends
its mixed audio data as output directly to the line, and what mixer
(if any) gets audio data as input directly from the line.
Subinterfaces of <code>Line</code> may have corresponding
subclasses of <code>Line.Info</code> that provide other kinds of
information specific to the particular types of line.</li>
<li>Controls<br />
<br />
A line can have various types of controls, such as gain, pan, and
reverb controls. Usually, a line has no more than one control of a
given type, but this is not a necessary limitation. Controls are
discussed in more detail below.</li>
<li>Open or closed status<br />
<br />
Opening and closing a line affects its resource allocation.
Successful opening of a line guarantees that resources have been
allocated to the line. Opening a mixer that has audio input and/or
output ports normally involves acquiring the native platform
hardware resource (sound card) and initializing any required
software components. Opening a line that is a data path in or out
of the mixer might involve device initialization as well as
allocation of limited resources from the mixer. In other words, a
mixer has a finite number of lines, so at some point multiple
applications (or the same application) might vie for usage of the
mixer.
<p>Closing a line indicates that any resources used by the line may
now be released. To free up resources, applications should close
lines whenever they are not in use, and must close all opened lines
when exiting.</p>
<p>Mixers are assumed to be shared system resources, and can be
opened and closed repeatedly. Other lines may or may not support
re-opening once they have been closed. Mechanisms for opening lines
vary with the different sub-types and are documented where they are
defined.</p>
</li>
<li>Events<br />
<br />
A line generates events when it opens or closes. The events are
instances of the <code>LineEvent</code> class. Two types of
<code>LineEvent</code> are <code>OPEN</code> and
<code>CLOSE</code>, but subinterfaces of <code>Line</code> can
introduce other types of events.<br />
<br />
When a line generates an <code>OPEN</code> or <code>CLOSE</code>
event, the event is sent to all objects that have registered to
&quot;listen&quot; for events on that line. Such objects must
implement the <code>LineListener</code> interface. An application
can create these objects, register them to listen for line events,
and react to the events as desired.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 2em"><b><code>Ports</code></b> are simple
lines for input or output of audio to or from audio devices. The
<code>Port</code> interface has an inner class,
<code>Port.Info</code>, that specifies the type of port. Some
common types are the microphone, line input, CD-ROM drive, speaker,
headphone, and line output.</div>
<div style="margin-left: 2em">
<p>The <b><code>Mixer</code></b> interface represents a hardware or
software device that has one or more input lines and one or more
output lines. This definition means that a mixer need not actually
mix data; it might have only a single input. The <code>Mixer</code>
API is intended to encompass a variety of devices, but the typical
case supports mixing.</p>
<p>The <code>Mixer</code> interface provides methods for obtaining
a mixer's lines. These can include target data lines, from which an
application can read captured audio data, source data lines, to
which an application can write audio data for playback (rendering),
and clips, in which an application can preload sound data for
playback. The mixer can lock these resources. For example, if the
mixer has only one target data line and it is already in use, an
attempt by an application to obtain a target data line will cause
an exception to be thrown.</p>
<p>You can query a mixer for lines of different types, by passing
the appropriate type of <code>Line.Info</code>. You can also ask
the mixer how many lines of a particular type it supports.</p>
<p>A mixer maintains textual information about its specific device
type in an inner class called <code>Mixer.Info</code>. This
information include the product's name, version, and vendor, along
with a textual description.</p>
<p>Notice that the generic <code>Line</code> interface does not
provide a means to start and stop playback or recording. For that
you need a data line. The <b><code>DataLine</code></b> interface
supplies the following additional media-related features beyond
those of a <code>Line</code>:</p>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 2em">
<ul>
<li><a name="AudioFormat" id="AudioFormat"></a>Audio format<br />
<br />
Each data line has an audio format associated with its data stream.
The format (an instance of <code>AudioFormat</code>) specifies the
arrangement of the bytes in the audio stream. Some of the format's
properties are the number of channels, the sample rate, the sample
size, and the encoding technique. Common encoding techniques
include linear pulse-code modulation (PCM), mu-law encoding, and
a-law encoding.</li>
<li>Media position<br />
<br />
A data line can report its current position in the media, expressed
in sample frames. This represents the number of sample frames
captured by or rendered from the data line since it was
opened.</li>
<li>Buffer size<br />
<br />
This is the size of the data line???s internal buffer in sample
frames. For a source data line, the internal buffer is one to which
data can be written, and for a target data line it???s one from which
data can be read.</li>
<li>Level<br />
<br />
The data line's level represents the current linear amplitude of
the audio signal, from 0 to 1.</li>
<li>Start and stop playback or capture</li>
<li style="list-style: none"><br /></li>
<li>Pause and resume<br />
<br />
Pausing a data line causes it to cease data I/O activity (capture
or playback) without discarding data or releasing resources.
Resuming the line enables it to continue data I/O activity. Pausing
a data line can result in an audible discontinuity (such as a
click) in playback or recording. To avoid overfilling the capture
buffer, an application that is recording audio should pause the
target data line from which it reads audio whenever it is not
prepared to read captured data continuously. Resuming a paused
source data line will play back the next samples from its queue,
unless the data line has been flushed.</li>
<li>Flush<br />
<br />
Flushing a data line discards unprocessed data from the queue and
returns. In some cases, not all queued data can be discarded. For
example, a mixer can flush data from the buffers in its source data
lines, but any unplayed data already in its internal buffer (which
contains the mixed output data) will still be played.</li>
<li>Drain<br />
<br />
Draining a data line blocks until all unprocessed data has been
drained from the queue, and the data line's buffer has become
empty. If you attempt to drain a data line whose buffer is still
being filled (either by the application or by a mixer), the
draining might not complete.</li>
<li>Active status<br />
<br />
A data line is considered active if it is engaged in active
presentation or capture of audio data to or from a mixer.</li>
<li>Events<br />
<br />
<code>START</code> and <code>STOP</code> events are produced when
active presentation or capture of data from or to the data line
starts or stops.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 2em">
<p>An application can obtain a data line from a mixer. If the data
line cannot be allocated because of resource constraints (for
example, if the mixer supports only one target data line and it is
already in use), an exception is thrown.</p>
<p>A <b><code>TargetDataLine</code></b> receives audio data from a
mixer. Commonly, the mixer has captured audio data from a port such
as a microphone; it might process or mix this captured audio before
placing the data in the target data line's buffer. The
<code>TargetDataLine</code> interface provides methods for reading
the data from the target data line's buffer and for determining how
much data is currently available for reading. If an application
attempts to read more data than is available, the read method
blocks until the requested amount of data is available. This
applies even if the amount of data requested is greater than the
line's buffer size. The read method returns if the line is closed,
paused, or flushed.<br />
<br />
Applications recording audio should read data from the target data
line fast enough to avoid overflow of the buffer, which results in
discontinuities in the captured data. If the buffer does overflow,
the oldest queued data is discarded and replaced by new
data.<br /></p>
<p>A <b><code>SourceDataLine</code></b> receives audio data for
playback. It provides methods for writing data to the source data
line's buffer for playback, and for determining how much data the
line is prepared to receive without blocking. If an application
attempts to write more data than is available, the read method
blocks until the requested amount of data can be written. This
applies even if the amount of data requested is greater than the
line's buffer size. The write method also returns if the line is
closed, paused, or flushed.</p>
<p>Applications playing audio should write data to the source data
line fast enough to avoid underflow (emptying) of the buffer, which
may result in discontinuities in audio playback. If audio playback
stops due to underflow, a <code>STOP</code> event is generated. A
<code>START</code> event is generated when presentation
resumes.</p>
<p>A <b><code>Clip</code></b> is a data line into which audio data
can be loaded prior to playback. Because the data is pre-loaded
rather than streamed, the clip???s duration is known before playback,
and you can choose any starting position in the media. Clips can be
looped, meaning that upon playback, all the data between two
specified loop points will repeat a specified number of times, or
indefinitely.</p>
A <b><code>GroupLine</code></b> is a synchronized group of data
lines. If a mixer supports group lines, you can specify which data
lines should be treated as a group. Then you can start, stop, or
close all those data lines by sending a single message to the
group, instead of having to control each line individually.<br />
<h4>Controls</h4>
<p>Data lines and ports often have a set of controls that affect
the audio signal passing through the line. The way in which the
signal is affected depends on the type of control. The Java Sound
API defines the following subclasses of <code>Control</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>GainControl</code><br />
<br />
This control allows the signal's volume to be boosted or cut a
specified number of decibels. A fade can be applied so that the
volume increases or decreases gradually instead of instantly. The
gain control includes a mute function to temporarily silence the
line without altering its gain setting. A <code>GainControl</code>
object can be queried for its resolution and for the minimum and
maximum gain values it permits. The resolution is expressed as the
number of increments over which the range of possible values is
distributed.<br />
<br />
The types of gain control defined by the API include an overall
gain control as well as gain controls for auxiliary send and
return. The send and return typically control a line's contribution
to a mixed and reverberated signal.</li>
<li><code>PanControl</code><br />
<br />
A pan control affects the sound's right-left positioning. For a
stereo audio signal, the pan control affects the balance between
the volumes of the left and right channels. An application can set
the pan position and can query the control for its resolution. The
resolution is expressed as the number of incremental values from
"hard left" to "hard right."</li>
<li><code>ReverbControl</code><br />
<br />
This control gives access to any number of reverberation settings.
Each setting might emulate a different time of room (small club,
concert hall, cavern, etc.). The parameters used in constructing
each setting consist of the delay time and intensity of early
reflections, the delay time and intensity of late reflections, and
an overall decay time.</li>
<li><code>SampleRateControl</code><br />
<br />
This control affects the rate of playback. Altering the audio
sample rate changes the sound's pitch. As with
<code>GainControl</code>, the change can be made gradually instead
of immediately, and the control can be queried for its resolution
and its minimum and maximum possible values.</li>
</ul>
<p>Programmatically, you obtain a particular control object from a
line through a reference to the control???s class. You can also
obtain an array of all the controls for that line.</p>
<br />
<h4>AudioSystem</h4>
The <code>AudioSystem</code> class serves as an application's entry
point for accessing the installed sampled-audio resources. You can
query the AudioSystem to learn what sorts of audio components have
been installed, and then you can obtain access to them. For
example, an application might start out by asking the
<code>AudioSystem</code> class whether there is a mixer that has a
certain configuration, such as one of the input or output
configurations illustrated earlier in the discussion of lines. From
the mixer, the application would then obtain data lines, and so on.
<p>Here are some of the resources an application can obtain from
the <code>AudioSystem</code>:<br />
<br /></p>
<ul>
<li>Mixers<br />
<br />
A mixer can be obtained by passing a specific
<code>Mixer.Info</code> object. You can learn what mixers are
available by invoking the <code>getMixerInfo</code> method, which
returns an array of <code>Mixer.Info</code> objects.</li>
<li>Lines<br />
<br />
An application can get a target data line or source data line
directly from the <code>AudioSystem</code>, without dealing
explicitly with mixers.</li>
<li>Format conversions<br />
<br />
<p>An application can use format conversions to translate audio
data from one format to another. (See the discussion of <a href=
"#AudioFormat"><b>AudioFormat</b></a> above.) Format conversions
are often used to compress and decompress audio data. An
application can query the <code>AudioSystem</code> to learn what
translations are supported. It can then pass the
<code>AudioSystem</code> a stream of audio data and get back a
translated stream in a particular format.</p>
</li>
<li>Files and streams<br />
<br />
<p>An audio stream is an input stream with a specified audio data
format (<code>AudioFormat</code>) and data length. The
<code>AudioInputStream</code> class represents such a stream, from
which you can read bytes. Some audio input streams permit you to
remember positions in the stream and skip around in it. The
<code>AudioSystem</code> class provides methods for translating
between audio files and audio streams. The <code>AudioSystem</code>
can also report the file format of a sound file and can write files
in the different formats. A file format is represented by the
<code>AudioFileFormat</code> class. An <code>AudioFileFormat</code>
includes an <code>AudioFormat</code>, the file's length, and its
type (WAV, AIFF, AU, etc.).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<br />
<br />
<h4>System configuration (SPI classes)</h4>
<p>Service provider interfaces for the sampled audio system are
defined in the <code>javax.sound.sampled.spi</code> package.
Service providers can extend the classes defined here so that their
own audio devices, sound file parsers and writers, and format
converters can be installed and made available by a Java Sound
implementation.</p>
</div>
<br />
<br />
<h3>MIDI</h3>
<div style="margin-left: 2em">
<p>Interfaces describing MIDI event transport, synthesis, and
sequencing are defined in the <code>javax.sound.midi</code>
package. The major concepts used in the package are described in
the sections below.</p>
<br />
<h4>Functional Overview</h4>
<p>The diagram below illustrates the functional relationships
between the major components in a typical Java Sound MIDI
configuration. (Java Sound permits a variety of devices to be
installed and interconnected. The system shown here is just one
possible scenario.) The flow of data between components is
indicated by arrows. The data can be in a standard file format, or
(as indicated by the key in the lower right corner of the diagram),
it can be audio, raw MIDI bytes, or Java Sound's
<code>MidiEvent</code> objects.</p>
<div style="margin-left: 2em">
<p align="center"><img src="Figures/typicalMidiArch.gif" alt=
"The following context describes this graphic" /></p>
<em>A Typical MIDI Configuration</em>
</div>
<p>In this example, the application prepares a musical performance
by loading a musical score that is stored as a Standard MIDI File
on a disk (lower left corner of the diagram). Standard MIDI files
contain tracks, each of which is a list of time-tagged MIDI events.
This MIDI file is read into a <code>Sequence</code> object, whose
data structure reflects the file. A <code>Sequence</code> contains
a set of <code>Track</code> objects, each of which contains a set
of <code>MidiEvent</code> objects. The <code>Sequence</code> is
then "performed" by a <code>Sequencer</code>. A
<code>Sequencer</code> performs its music by sending
<code>MidiEvents</code> to some other device, such as an internal
or external synthesizer.</p>
<p>As illustrated, <code>MidiEvents</code> must be translated into
raw (non-time-tagged) MIDI before being sent through a MIDI output
port to an external synthesizer. This conversion is accomplished by
a a MIDI-output device called a <code>StreamGenerator</code>.
Similarly, raw MIDI data coming into the computer from an external
MIDI source is translated into <code>MidiEvents</code> by a
<code>StreamParser</code>.</p>
<p>The internal synthesizer (the rectangle marked "Synthesizer" in
the diagram) accepts <code>MidiEvents</code> directly from the
<code>Sequencer</code> or <code>StreamParser</code>. It parses each
event and usually dispatches a corresponding command (such as
<code>noteOn</code>) to one of its <code>MidiChannel</code>
objects, according to the MIDI channel number specified in the
event. (The MIDI Specification calls for 16 MIDI channels, so a
<code>Synthesizer</code> typically has 16 <code>MidiChannel</code>
objects.)</p>
<p>The <code>MidiChannel</code> uses the note information in these
messages to synthesize music. For example, a <code>noteOn</code>
message specifies the note's pitch and "velocity" (volume).
However, the note information is insufficient; the synthesizer also
requires precise instructions on how to create the audio signal for
each note. These instructions are represented by an
<code>Instrument</code>. Each <code>Instrument</code> typically
emulates a different real-world musical instrument or sound effect.
The <code>Instruments</code> might come as presets with the
synthesizer, or they might be loaded from soundbank files. In the
synthesizer, the <code>Instruments</code> are arranged by bank
number (the rows in the diagram) and program number (the columns).
An <code>Instrument</code> can make use of stored digital audio,
included as <code>Sample</code> objects in the soundbank. For
example, to play the sound of a trumpet playing a 5-second-long
note, the synthesizer might loop (cycle) through a half-second
snippet of a recording of a trumpet.</p>
<p>Now that the components have been introduced from a functional
perspective, we will take a brief look at the API from a
programmatic perspective.</p>
<br />
<h4>MidiEvent</h4>
<p>A <code>MidiEvent</code> object specifies the type, data length,
and status byte of the raw MIDI message for which it serves as a
wrapper. In addition, it provides a tick value that is used by
devices involved in MIDI timing, such as sequencers.</p>
<p>There are three categories of events, each represented by a
<code>MidiEvent</code> subclass:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ShortEvents</code> are the most common and have at most
two data bytes following the status byte.</li>
<li><code>SysexEvents</code> contain system-exclusive MIDI
messages. They may have many bytes, and generally contain
manufacturer-specific instructions.</li>
<li><code>MetaEvents</code> occur in MIDI files, but not in raw
MIDI data streams. Meta events contain data, such as lyrics or
tempo settings, that might be useful to sequencers but are usually
meaningless for synthesizers.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<h4>MidiDevice</h4>
<p>The base interface for devices is <code>MidiDevice</code>. All
devices provide methods for listing the set of MIDI modes that they
support, and for querying and setting the current mode. (The mode
is a combination of MIDI's Omni mode and Mono/Poly mode.) Devices
can be opened and closed, and they provide descriptions of
themselves through a <code>MidiDevice.Info</code> object.</p>
<p>The following diagram illustrates the <code>MidiDevice</code>
interface hierarchy. Also depicted are two classes, connected by
dashed lines to the <code>MidiDevice</code> interfaces they
implement.</p>
<div style="margin-left: 2em">
<p align="center"><img src="Figures/midiDevices.gif" alt=
"The following context describes this graphic" /></p>
<em>MidiDevice Hierarchy</em>
</div>
<p>Devices are generally either transmitters or receivers of
<code>MidiEvents</code>. The <code>Transmitter</code> subinterface
of <code>MidiDevice</code> includes methods for setting and
querying the receivers to which the transmitter is sending
<code>MidiEvents</code>. From the perspective of a transmitter,
these receivers fall into two categories: MIDI Out and MIDI Thru.
The transmitter sends events that it generates itself to its MIDI
Out receivers. If the transmitter is itself also a receiver, it
passes along events that it has received from elsewhere to its MIDI
Thru receivers. The <code>Receiver</code> subinterface of
<code>MidiDevice</code> consists of a single method for receiving
<code>MidiEvents</code>. Typically, this method is invoked by a
<code>Transmitter</code>.</p>
<p>Java Sound includes concrete classes for converting between
<code>MidiEvent</code> objects and the raw byte stream used in MIDI
wire protocol. A <code>StreamGenerator</code> is a
<code>Receiver</code> that accepts <code>MidiEvent</code> objects
from a <code>Transmitter</code> and writes out a raw MIDI byte
stream. Similarly, a <code>StreamParser</code> is a
<code>Transmitter</code> that accepts a raw MIDI byte stream and
writes the corresponding <code>MidiEvent</code> objects to its
<code>Receiver</code>.</p>

<h4>Synthesis</h4>
<p>A <code>Synthesizer</code> is a type of <code>MidiDevice</code>
that generates sound. The <code>Synthesizer</code> interface
extends both <code>Receiver</code> and <code>Transmitter</code>. It
provides methods for manipulating soundbanks and instruments. In
addition, it provides access to a set of MIDI channels through
which sound is actually produced. A <code>Synthesizer</code>
receives <code>MidiEvents</code> and invokes corresponding
<code>MidiChannel</code> messages.</p>
<p><code>MidiChannels</code> have methods representing the common
MIDI voice messages such as "note on" and "control change." They
also permit queries of the channel's current state.</p>
<br />
<h4>Sequencing</h4>
<p>Like <code>Synthesizer</code>, the <code>Sequencer</code>
interface extends both <code>Transmitter</code> and
<code>Receiver</code> (and therefore <code>MidiDevice</code>).
<code>Sequencer</code> adds methods for basic MIDI sequencing
operations. A sequencer can load and play back a sequence, query
and set the tempo, and control the master and slave sync modes. An
application can register to be notified when the sequencer
processes <code>MetaEvents</code> and controller events. (A
controller event occurs when a MIDI controller, such as a
pitch-bend wheel or a data slider, changes its value. These events
are not <code>MidiEvents</code>, but are created when the
<code>Sequencer</code> encounters certain <code>ShortEvents</code>
in the <code>Sequence</code>.)</p>
<p>The <code>Sequence</code> object represents a MIDI sequence as
one or more tracks and associated timing information. A track
contains a list of time-stamped MIDI events. Sequences can be read
from MIDI files, or created from scratch and edited by adding
<code>Tracks</code> to the <code>Sequence</code> (or removing
them). Similarly, <code>MidiEvents</code> can be added to or
removed from the <code>Tracks</code>.</p>
A track contains a list of time-stamped MIDI events. Sequences can
be read from MIDI files, or created from scratch and edited by
adding <code>Tracks</code> to the <code>Sequence</code> (or
removing them). Similarly, <code>MidiEvents</code> can be added to
or removed from the <code>Tracks</code>.
<p>It is not necessary to load a MIDI file into a
<code>Sequence</code> object before playing the file. The
<code>setSequence(java.io.InputStream)</code> method of
<code>Sequencer</code> lets you read a MIDI file directly into a
<code>Sequencer</code>, without creating a <code>Sequence</code>
object first.</p>
<br />
<h4>MidiSystem</h4>
<p><code>MidiSystem</code> acts as an application's entry point to
the MIDI music system. It provides information about, and access
to, the set of installed devices, including transmitters,
receivers, synthesizers, and sequencers.</p>
<p>The <code>MidiSystem</code> class provides methods for reading
MIDI files to create <code>Sequence</code> objects, and for writing
<code>Sequences</code> to MIDI files. A MIDI Type 0 file contains
only one track, while a Type 1 file may contain any number.
<code>MidiSystem</code> also provides methods to create
<code>Soundbank</code> objects by parsing soundbank files.</p>
<br />
<h4>System configuration (SPI interfaces)</h4>
<p>Configuration of the MIDI system is handled in the
<code>javax.sound.midi.spi package</code>. The abstract classes in
this package allow service providers to supply and install their
own MIDI devices, MIDI file readers and writers, and soundbank file
readers.</p>
