<h2><a name="a1.0" id="a1.0">1.0 Java Logging Overview</a></h2>
<p>The logging APIs are described in detail in the <a href=
"../../../api/java/util/logging/package-summary.html">Java SE API
Specification</a>. The goal of this document is to provide an
overview of key elements.</p>
<h3><a name="a1.1" id="a1.1">1.1 Overview of Control Flow</a></h3>
<p>Applications make logging calls on <i>Logger</i> objects.
Loggers are organized in a hierarchical namespace and child Loggers
may inherit some logging properties from their parents in the
namespace.</p>
<p>Applications make logging calls on <i>Logger</i> objects. These
Logger objects allocate <i>LogRecord</i> objects which are passed
to <i>Handler</i> objects for publication. Both Loggers and
Handlers may use logging <i>Levels</i> and (optionally)
<i>Filters</i> to decide if they are interested in a particular
<i>LogRecord</i>. When it is necessary to publish a LogRecord
externally, a Handler can (optionally) use a <i>Formatter</i> to
localize and format the message before publishing it to an I/O
stream.</p>
<img src="logging1.gif" alt=
"The previous context describes this graphic" />
<p>Each Logger keeps track of a set of output Handlers. By default
all Loggers also send their output to their parent Logger. But
Loggers may also be configured to ignore Handlers higher up the
tree.</p>
<p>Some Handlers may direct output to other Handlers. For example,
the <i>MemoryHandler</i> maintains an internal ring buffer of
<i>LogRecords</i> and on trigger events it publishes its LogRecords
through a target Handler. In such cases, any formatting is done by
the last Handler in the chain.</p>
<img src="logging2.gif" alt=
"The previous context describes this graphic" />
<p>The APIs are structured so that calls on the Logger APIs can be
cheap when logging is disabled. If logging is disabled for a given
log level, then the Logger can make a cheap comparison test and
return. If logging is enabled for a given log level, the Logger is
still careful to minimize costs before passing the LogRecord into
the Handlers. In particular, localization and formatting (which are
relatively expensive) are deferred until the Handler requests them.
For example, a MemoryHandler can maintain a circular buffer of
LogRecords without having to pay formatting costs.</p>
<h3><a name="a1.2" id="a1.2">1.2 Log Levels</a></h3>
<p>Each log message has an associated log <i>Level</i>. The Level
gives a rough guide to the importance and urgency of a log message.
Log level objects encapsulate an integer value, with higher values
indicating higher priorities.</p>
<p>The <tt>Level</tt> class defines seven standard log levels,
ranging from FINEST (the lowest priority, with the lowest value) to
SEVERE (the highest priority, with the highest value).</p>
<h3><a name="a1.3" id="a1.3">1.3 Loggers</a></h3>
<p>As stated earlier, client code sends log requests to Logger
objects. Each logger keeps track of a log level that it is
interested in, and discards log requests that are below this
level.</p>
<p>Loggers are normally named entities, using dot-separated names
such as &quot;java.awt&quot;. The namespace is hierarchical and is
managed by the LogManager. The namespace should typically be
aligned with the Java packaging namespace, but is not required to
follow it slavishly. For example, a Logger called
&quot;java.awt&quot; might handle logging requests for classes in
the java.awt package, but it might also handle logging for classes
in sun.awt that support the client-visible abstractions defined in
the java.awt package.</p>
<p>In addition to named Loggers, it is also possible to create
anonymous Loggers that don't appear in the shared namespace. See
section <a href="#a1.14">1.14</a>.</p>
<p>Loggers keep track of their parent loggers in the logging
namespace. A logger's parent is its nearest extant ancestor in the
logging namespace. The root Logger (named "") has no parent.
Anonymous loggers are all given the root logger as their parent.
Loggers may inherit various attributes from their parents in the
logger namespace. In particular, a logger may inherit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Logging level. If a Logger's level is set to be null then the
Logger will use an effective Level that will be obtained by walking
up the parent tree and using the first non-null Level.</li>
<li>Handlers. By default a Logger will log any output messages to
its parent's handlers, and so on recursively up the tree.</li>
<li>Resource bundle names. If a logger has a null resource bundle
name, then it will inherit any resource bundle name defined for its
parent, and so on recursively up the tree.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="a1.4" id="a1.4">1.4 Logging Methods</a></h3>
<p>The Logger class provides a large set of convenience methods for
generating log messages. For convenience, there are methods for
each logging level, named after the logging level name. Thus rather
than calling &quot;logger.log(Level.WARNING,...&quot; a developer
can simply call the convenience method
&quot;logger.warning(...&quot;</p>
<p>There are two different styles of logging methods, to meet the
needs of different communities of users.</p>
<p>First, there are methods that take an explicit source class name
and source method name. These methods are intended for developers
who want to be able to quickly locate the source of any given
logging message. An example of this style is:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
void warning(String sourceClass, String sourceMethod, String msg);
</pre>
<p>Second, there are a set of methods that do not take explicit
source class or source method names. These are intended for
developers who want easy-to-use logging and do not require detailed
source information.</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
void warning(String msg);
</pre>
<p>For this second set of methods, the Logging framework will make
a &quot;best effort&quot; to determine which class and method
called into the logging framework and will add this information
into the LogRecord. However, it is important to realize that this
automatically inferred information may only be approximate. The
latest generation of virtual machines perform extensive
optimizations when JITing and may entirely remove stack frames,
making it impossible to reliably locate the calling class and
method.</p>
<h3><a name="a1.5" id="a1.5">1.5 Handlers</a></h3>
<p>Java SE provides the following Handlers:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>StreamHandler:</i> A simple handler for writing formatted
records to an OutputStream.</li>
<li><i>ConsoleHandler:</i> A simple handler for writing formatted
records to System.err</li>
<li><i>FileHandler:</i> A handler that writes formatted log records
either to a single file, or to a set of rotating log files.</li>
<li><i>SocketHandler:</i> A handler that writes formatted log
records to remote TCP ports.</li>
<li><i>MemoryHandler:</i> A handler that buffers log records in
memory.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is fairly straightforward to develop new Handlers. Developers
requiring specific functionality can either develop a Handler from
scratch or subclass one of the provided Handlers.</p>
<h3><a name="a1.6" id="a1.6">1.6 Formatters</a></h3>
Java SE also includes two standard Formatters:
<ul>
<li><i>SimpleFormatter</i>: Writes brief &quot;human-readable&quot;
summaries of log records.</li>
<li><i>XMLFormatter</i>: Writes detailed XML-structured
information.</li>
</ul>
<p>As with Handlers, it is fairly straightforward to develop new
Formatters.</p>
<h3><a name="a1.7" id="a1.7">1.7 The LogManager</a></h3>
There is a global LogManager object that keeps track of global
logging information. This includes:
<ul>
<li>A hierarchical namespace of named Loggers.</li>
<li>A set of logging control properties read from the configuration
file. See section <a href="#a1.8">1.8</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a single LogManager object that can be retrieved using
the static LogManager.getLogManager method. This is created during
LogManager initialization, based on a system property. This
property allows container applications (such as EJB containers) to
substitute their own subclass of LogManager in place of the default
class.</p>
<h3><a name="a1.8" id="a1.8">1.8 Configuration File</a></h3>
<p>The logging configuration can be initialized using a logging
configuration file that will be read at startup. This logging
configuration file is in standard java.util.Properties format.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the logging configuration can be initialized by
specifying a class that can be used for reading initialization
properties. This mechanism allows configuration data to be read
from arbitrary sources, such as LDAP, JDBC, etc. See the <a href=
"../../../api/java/util/logging/LogManager.html">LogManager API
Specification</a> for details.</p>
<p>There is a small set of global configuration information. This
is specified in the description of the LogManager class and
includes a list of root-level Handlers to install during
startup.</p>
<p>The initial configuration may specify levels for particular
loggers. These levels are applied to the named logger and any
loggers below it in the naming hierarchy. The levels are applied in
the order they are defined in the configuration file.</p>
<p>The initial configuration may contain arbitrary properties for
use by Handlers or by subsystems doing logging. By convention these
properties should use names starting with the name of the handler
class or the name of the main Logger for the subsystem.</p>
<p>For example, the MemoryHandler uses a property
&quot;java.util.logging.MemoryHandler.size&quot; to determine the
default size for its ring buffer.</p>
<h3><a name="a1.9" id="a1.9">1.9 Default Configuration</a></h3>
<p>The default logging configuration that ships with the JRE is
only a default, and can be overridden by ISVs, system admins, and
end users.</p>
<p>The default configuration makes only limited use of disk space.
It doesn't flood the user with information, but does make sure to
always capture key failure information.</p>
<p>The default configuration establishes a single handler on the
root logger for sending output to the console.</p>
<h3><a name="a1.10" id="a1.10">1.10 Dynamic Configuration
Updates</a></h3>
Programmers can update the logging configuration at run time in a
variety of ways:
<ul>
<li>FileHandlers, MemoryHandlers, and PrintHandlers can all be
created with various attributes.</li>
<li>New Handlers can be added and old ones removed.</li>
<li>New Loggers can be created and can be supplied with specific
Handlers.</li>
<li>Levels can be set on target Handlers.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="a1.11" id="a1.11">1.11 Native Methods</a></h3>
There are no native APIs for logging.
<p>Native code that wishes to use the Java Logging mechanisms
should make normal JNI calls into the Java Logging APIs.</p>
<h3><a name="a1.12" id="a1.12">1.12 XML DTD</a></h3>
<p>The XML DTD used by the XMLFormatter is specified in <a href=
"#a3.0">Appendix A</a>.</p>
The DTD is designed with a &quot;&lt;log&gt;&quot; element as the
top-level document. Individual log records are then written as
&quot;&lt;record&gt;&quot; elements.
<p>Note that in the event of JVM crashes it may not be possible to
cleanly terminate an XMLFormatter stream with the appropriate
closing &lt;/log&gt;. Therefore tools that are analyzing log
records should be prepared to cope with un-terminated streams.</p>
<h3><a name="a1.13" id="a1.13">1.13 Unique Message IDs</a></h3>
<p>The Java Logging APIs do not provide any direct support for
unique message IDs. Those applications or subsystems requiring
unique message IDs should define their own conventions and include
the unique IDs in the message strings as appropriate.</p>
<h3><a name="a1.14" id="a1.14">1.14 Security</a></h3>
<p>The principal security requirement is that untrusted code should
not be able to change the logging configuration. Specifically, if
the logging configuration has been set up to log a particular
category of information to a particular Handler, then untrusted
code should not be able to prevent or disrupt that logging.</p>
<p>A new security permission LoggingPermission is defined to
control updates to the logging configuration.</p>
<p>Trusted applications are given the appropriate LoggingPermission
so they can call any of the logging configuration APIs. Untrusted
applets are a different story. Untrusted applets can create and use
named Loggers in the normal way, but they are not allowed to change
logging control settings, such as adding or removing handlers, or
changing log levels. However, untrusted applets are able to create
and use their own &quot;anonymous&quot; loggers, using
Logger.getAnonymousLogger. These anonymous Loggers are not
registered in the global namespace and their methods are not
access-checked, allowing even untrusted code to change their
logging control settings.</p>
<p>The logging framework does not attempt to prevent spoofing. The
sources of logging calls cannot be determined reliably, so when a
LogRecord is published that claims to be from a particular source
class and source method, it may be a fabrication. Similarly,
formatters such as the XMLFormatter do not attempt to protect
themselves against nested log messages inside message strings.
Thus, a spoof LogRecord might contain a spoof set of XML inside its
message string to make it look as if there was an additional XML
record in the output.</p>
<p>In addition, the logging framework does not attempt to protect
itself against denial of service attacks. Any given logging client
can flood the logging framework with meaningless messages in an
attempt to conceal some important log message.</p>
<h3><a name="a1.15" id="a1.15">1.15 Configuration
Management</a></h3>
<p>The APIs are structured so that an initial set of configuration
information is read as properties from a configuration file. The
configuration information may then be changed programatically by
calls on the various logging classes and objects.</p>
<p>In addition, there are methods on LogManager that allow the
configuration file to be re-read. When this happens, the
configuration file values will override any changes that have been
made programatically.</p>
<h3><a name="a1.16" id="a1.16">1.16 Packaging</a></h3>
<p>All of the logging class are in the java.* part of the
namespace, in the java.util.logging package.</p>
<h3><a name="a1.17" id="a1.17">1.17 Localization</a></h3>
<p>Log messages may need to be localized.</p>
<p>Each Logger may have a Resource Bundle name associated with it.
The corresponding Resource Bundle can be used to map between raw
message strings and localized message strings.</p>
<p>Normally localization will be performed by Formatters. As a
convenience, the formatter class provides a formatMessage method
that provides some basic localization and formatting support.</p>
<h3><a name="a1.18" id="a1.18">1.18 Remote Access and
Serialization</a></h3>
<p>As with most Java platform APIs, the logging APIs are designed
for use inside a single address space. All calls are intended to be
local. However, it is expected that some Handlers will want to
forward their output to other systems. There are a variety of ways
of doing this:</p>
<p>Some Handlers (such as the SocketHandler) may write data to
other systems using the XMLFormatter. This provides a simple,
standard, inter-change format that can be parsed and processed on a
variety of systems.</p>
<p>Some Handlers may wish to pass LogRecord objects over RMI. The
LogRecord class is therefore serializable. However there is a
problem in how to deal with the LogRecord parameters. Some
parameters may not be serializable and other parameters may have
been designed to serialize much more state than is required for
logging. To avoid these problems the LogRecord class has a custom
writeObject method that converts the parameters to strings (using
Object.toString()) before writing them out. See the <a href=
"../../../api/java/util/logging/LogRecord.html">LogRecord API
Specification</a> for details.</p>
<p>Most of the logging classes are not intended to be serializable.
Both Loggers and Handlers are stateful classes that are tied into a
specific virtual machine. In this respect they are analogous to the
java.io classes, which are also not serializable.</p>
<h2><a name="a2.0" id="a2.0">2.0 Examples</a></h2>
<h3><a name="a2.1" id="a2.1">2.1 Simple Use</a></h3>
<p>The following is a small program that performs logging using the
default configuration.</p>
<p>This program relies on the root handlers that were established
by the LogManager based on the configuration file. It creates its
own Logger object and then makes calls to that Logger object to
report various events.</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
package com.wombat;
import java.util.logging.*;

public class Nose{
    // Obtain a suitable logger.
    private static Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(&quot;com.wombat.nose&quot;);
    public static void main(String argv[]) {
        // Log a FINE tracing message
        logger.fine(&quot;doing stuff&quot;);
        try{
            Wombat.sneeze();
        } catch (Exception ex) {
            // Log the exception

        }
        logger.fine(&quot;done&quot;);
    }
}
</pre>
<h3><a name="a2.2" id="a2.2">2.2 Changing the
Configuration</a></h3>
<p>Here's a small program that dynamically adjusts the logging
configuration to send output to a specific file and to get lots of
information on wombats. The pattern &quot;%t&quot; means the system
temporary directory.</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
public static void main(String[] args) {
    Handler fh = new FileHandler(&quot;%t/wombat.log&quot;);

<h3><a name="a2.3" id="a2.3">2.3 Simple Use, Ignoring Global

<p>Here's a small program that sets up its own logging Handler and
ignores the global configuration.</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
