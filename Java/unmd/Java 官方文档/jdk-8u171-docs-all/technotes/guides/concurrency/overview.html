<h1>Concurrency Utilities<br />
Overview</h1>
<!-- Body text begins here -->
<p>The Java platform includes a package of <i>concurrency
utilities</i>. These are classes that are designed to be used as
building blocks in building concurrent classes or applications.
Just as the collections framework simplified the organization and
manipulation of in-memory data by providing implementations of
commonly used data structures, the concurrency utilities simplify
the development of concurrent classes by providing implementations
of building blocks commonly used in concurrent designs. The
concurrency utilities include a high-performance, flexible thread
pool; a framework for asynchronous execution of tasks; a host of
collection classes optimized for concurrent access; synchronization
utilities such as counting semaphores; atomic variables; locks; and
condition variables.</p>
<p>Using the concurrency utilities, instead of developing
components such as thread pools yourself, offers a number of
advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reduced programming effort.</strong> It is easier to
use a standard class than to develop it yourself.</li>
<li><strong>Increased performance.</strong> The implementations in
the concurrency utilities were developed and peer-reviewed by
concurrency and performance experts; these implementations are
likely to be faster and more scalable than a typical
implementation, even by a skilled developer.</li>
<li><strong>Increased reliability.</strong> Developing concurrent
classes is difficult -- the low-level concurrency primitives
provided by the Java language (<code>synchronized</code>,
<code>volatile</code>, <code>wait()</code>, <code>notify()</code>,
and <code>notifyAll()</code>) are difficult to use correctly, and
errors using these facilities can be difficult to detect and debug.
By using standardized, extensively tested concurrency building
blocks, many potential sources of threading hazards such as
deadlock, starvation, race conditions, or excessive context
switching are eliminated. The concurrency utilities were carefully
audited for deadlock, starvation, and race conditions.</li>
<li><strong>Improved maintainability.</strong> Programs that use
standard library classes are easier to understand and maintain than
those that rely on complicated, homegrown classes.</li>
<li><strong>Increased productivity.</strong> Developers are likely
to already understand the standard library classes, so there is no
need to learn the API and behavior of ad hoc concurrent components.
Additionally, concurrent applications are simpler to debug when
they are built on reliable, well-tested components.</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, using the concurrency utilities to implement a
concurrent application can help your program be clearer, shorter,
faster, more reliable, more scalable, easier to write, easier to
read, and easier to maintain.</p>
<p>The concurrency utilities includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Task scheduling framework</strong>. The <a href=
"../../../api/java/util/concurrent/Executor.html"><code>Executor</code></a>
interface standardizes invocation, scheduling, execution, and
control of asynchronous tasks according to a set of execution
policies. Implementations are provided that enable tasks to be
executed within the submitting thread, in a <a href=
"../../../api/java/util/concurrent/Executors.html#newSingleThreadExecutor--">
single background thread</a> (as with events in Swing), in a newly
created thread, or in a <a href=
"../../../api/java/util/concurrent/Executors.html#newFixedThreadPool-int-">
thread pool</a>, and developers can create customized
implementations of <a href=
"../../../api/java/util/concurrent/AbstractExecutorService.html">Executor</a>
that support arbitrary execution policies. The built-in
implementations offer configurable policies such as queue length
limits and <a href=
"../../../api/java/util/concurrent/RejectedExecutionHandler.html">saturation
policy</a> that can improve the stability of applications by
preventing runaway resource use.</li>
<li><b>Fork/join framework</b>. Based on the <tt><a href=
"../../../api/java/util/concurrent/ForkJoinPool.html">ForkJoinPool</a></tt>
class, this framework is an implementation of <tt>Executor</tt>. It
is designed to efficiently run a large number of tasks using a pool
of worker threads. A <i>work-stealing</i> technique is used to keep
all the worker threads busy, to take full advantage of multiple
processors.</li>
<li><strong>Concurrent collections</strong>. Several new
collections classes were added, including the new <a href=
"../../../api/java/util/Queue.html"><code>Queue</code></a>,
<a href="../../../api/java/util/concurrent/BlockingQueue.html"><code>
BlockingQueue</code></a> and <a href=
"../../../api/java/util/concurrent/BlockingDeque.html"><code>BlockingDeque</code></a>
interfaces, and high-performance, concurrent implementations of
<code>Map</code>, <code>List</code>, and <code>Queue</code>. See
the <a href="../collections/">Collections Framework Guide</a> for
more information.</li>
<li><strong>Atomic variables</strong>. Utility classes are provided
that atomically manipulate single variables (primitive types or
references), providing high-performance atomic arithmetic and
compare-and-set methods. The atomic variable implementations in the
<a href=
"../../../api/java/util/concurrent/atomic/package-summary.html#package_description">
<code>java.util.concurrent.atomic</code></a> package offer higher
performance than would be available by using synchronization (on
most platforms), making them useful for implementing
high-performance concurrent algorithms and conveniently
implementing counters and sequence number generators.</li>
<li><strong>Synchronizers</strong>. General purpose synchronization
classes, including <a href=
"../../../api/java/util/concurrent/Semaphore.html">semaphores</a>,
<a href=
"../../../api/java/util/concurrent/CyclicBarrier.html">barriers</a>,
<a href=
"../../../api/java/util/concurrent/CountDownLatch.html">latches</a>,
<a href=
"../../../api/java/util/concurrent/Phaser.html">phasers</a>, and
<a href=
"../../../api/java/util/concurrent/Exchanger.html">exchangers</a>,
facilitate coordination between threads.</li>
<li><strong>Locks</strong>. While locking is built into the Java
language through the <tt>synchronized</tt> keyword, there are a
number of limitations to built-in monitor locks. The <a href=
"../../../api/java/util/concurrent/locks/package-summary.html#package_description">
<code>java.util.concurrent.locks</code></a> package provides a
high-performance lock implementation with the same memory semantics
as synchronization, and it also supports specifying a timeout when
attempting to acquire a lock, multiple condition variables per
lock, nonnested ("hand-over-hand") holding of multiple locks, and
support for interrupting threads that are waiting to acquire a
lock.</li>
<li><strong>Nanosecond-granularity timing</strong>. The <a href=
"../../../api/java/lang/System.html#nanoTime--"><code>System.nanoTime</code></a>
method enables access to a nanosecond-granularity time source for
making relative time measurements and methods that accept timeouts
(such as the <a href=
"../../../api/java/util/concurrent/BlockingQueue.html#offer-E-long-java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit-">
<code>BlockingQueue.offer</code></a>, <a href=
"../../../api/java/util/concurrent/BlockingQueue.html#poll-long-java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit-">
<code>BlockingQueue.poll</code></a>, <a href=
"../../../api/java/util/concurrent/locks/Lock.html#tryLock-long-java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit-">
<code>Lock.tryLock</code></a>, <a href=
"../../../api/java/util/concurrent/locks/Condition.html#await-long-java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit-">
<code>Condition.await</code></a>, and <a href=
"../../../api/java/lang/Thread.html#sleep-long-int-"><code>Thread.sleep</code></a>)
can take timeout values in nanoseconds. The actual precision of the
<code>System.nanoTime</code> method is platform-dependent.</li>
</ul>
