<h2><a name="FrameworkArchitecture" id=
"FrameworkArchitecture"></a>1. Framework Architecture</h2>
<p>The following picture shows the overall structure of the
framework and its clients. Parts outlined in bold are integrated
with the input method framework as part of the Java SE platform;
others can be developed and distributed separately by independent
software vendors.</p>
<img src="framework.gif" alt=
"The following context describes this graphic" width="382" height=
"204" align="bottom" />
<p>The input method client API defines the classes and interfaces
that text editing components can use to implement an integrated
text input user interface. The AWT text components
<tt>TextArea</tt> and <tt>TextField</tt> provide on-the-spot or
over-the-spot composition, depending on implementation. The text
components of the Swing user interface toolkit provide an
integrated text input user interface. The context management
manages communication paths between the text editing components and
input methods. The input method engine SPI defines the interfaces
that allow input method engines and adapters to be plugged into the
framework. Input method engines can be implemented directly in the
Java programming language using these interfaces. To use native
input methods integrated with the host input method manager, an
adapter translates information between the data models used by
native input methods and the input method framework and provides
the composition window. Adapters for other input systems, such as
Java Speech or the Internet-Intranet Input Method Protocol (IIIMP),
can also be implemented using this interface.</p>
<hr />
<h2><a name="ClientComponents" id="ClientComponents"></a>2. Client
Components</h2>
<p>Every instance of the <tt>Component</tt> class is potentially a
client of the input method framework. The framework distinguishes
between four kinds of components:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Active clients</i> are components whose <tt><a href=
"../../../api/java/awt/Component.html#getInputMethodRequests--">getInputMethodRequests</a></tt>
implementations return a non-null value. The framework assumes that
these components actively use the input method client API and, in
particular, provide an implementation of the <tt><a href=
"../../../api/java/awt/event/InputMethodListener.html">InputMethodListener</a></tt>
interface. These components are expected to handle events and
requests for information coming from the input method and draw
composed text that is sent to them.</li>
<li><i>Non-clients</i> are components that have turned off input
method support using the <tt><a href=
"../../../api/java/awt/Component.html#enableInputMethods-boolean-">enableInputMethods</a></tt>
method.</li>
<li><i>Peered clients</i> are peered text components (instances of
the <tt>TextComponent</tt> class). Their behavior is implementation
dependent, and their input method support may be limited. On Windows, peered text components
behave mostly like active clients. On Solaris, peered text components can receive input
only from host input methods, and they do not support the
below-the-spot input style (see below).</li>
<li><i>Passive clients</i> are all remaining components. The
framework assumes that passive clients don't use the input method
client API, but still need to receive text input from input
methods.</li>
</ul>
<p>All four kinds of components may coexist in the same window. The
input method framework, therefore, needs to determine the
capabilities of components and adjust its behavior as the focus
moves from one component to another.</p>
<p>Client components are not responsible for drawing candidate
lists or for user interface elements that control the input
method's behavior. Depending on the platform, this responsibility
rests with input methods, the host input method manager, or the
input method framework.</p>
<p>Input methods are not concerned with the differences between
client components. They interact with them indirectly through the
input method framework, which presents an interface similar to an
active client and handles the differences internally.</p>
<hr />
<h2><a name="InputStyles" id="InputStyles"></a>3. Input Styles</h2>
<p>The input method framework supports three input styles:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>On-the-spot</i> input, where the client component draws the
composed text in the context of the document that it will
eventually belong to, but in a style that indicates that the text
still needs to be converted or confirmed by the input method. This
is the default input style for active clients.</li>
<li><i>Below-the-spot</i> input, where the composed text is shown
in a separate composition window that is automatically positioned
just below the insertion point where text will be inserted after
being committed. The window's location is calculated first when the
window is opened, then updated whenever committed text has been
dispatched to the client component. If positioning the window below
the insertion point would move it partially or entirely off-screen,
it is moved above the insertion point. This input style may be
selected for active clients as described below.</li>
<li><i>Root-window</i> input, where the composed text is shown in a
separate composition window that is not automatically positioned.
This input style is used for passive clients.</li>
</ul>
<p>The framework chooses between on-the-spot and below-the-spot
input for active clients based on a system property or an AWT
property "java.awt.im.style". The system property can be defined
from the command line (by the end user), the AWT property in a
localized awt.properties file (by the localizer or a system
administrator). If both are defined, the system property takes
precedence. If the property's value is "below-the-spot",
below-the-spot input is used, otherwise on-the-spot input.</p>
<p>Support for below-the-spot input with native input methods is
platform dependent. It is
supported on Windows, but not on Solaris. Where it is not
supported, on-the-spot input is used instead.</p>
<p>The input style used for peered text components (instances of
the <tt>TextComponent</tt> class) is implementation dependent and
may not be any of the styles described above. On Windows, below-the-spot input may be
selected as described above, otherwise over-the-spot input is used,
where composed text is drawn in a separate window covering the
insertion point. On Solaris,
the input style depends on the input method.</p>
<p>No input style is associated with non-clients.</p>
<p>Input methods are not concerned with the differences between
input styles. They interact with client components indirectly
through the input method framework, which presents an interface
assuming on-the-spot input and handles the differences
internally.</p>
<hr />
<h2><a name="InputMethodEnginesandAdapters" id=
"InputMethodEnginesandAdapters"></a>4. Input Method Engines and
Adapters</h2>
<p>The input method engine SPI enables the development of input
methods in the Java programming language. Adapters for other input
systems, such as Java Speech or the Internet-Intranet Input Method
Protocol, can also be implemented using this interface. For
information specific to the SPI, see the <a href=
"../../../api/java/awt/im/spi/package-summary.html#package_specification">
SPI package specification</a>.</p>
<p>The SPI is also used for host input method adapters, which
connect to native input methods integrated with the host input
method managers, such as the Input Method Manager on Microsoft
Windows, the Text Services Manager on MacOS, and XIM on Solaris.
The host input method adapter plays the role of an input method
within the input method framework, and translates events and
requests between the data models used by AWT and the input method
framework on one side and the host's input method manager on the
other side. It also cooperates with the input context in managing
the composition window - for passive clients interacting host input
methods, typically the root window provided by the host input
method manager is used. The adapter passes on requests for
particular input methods to the host, but users can also use the
host's selection mechanism to select input methods.</p>
<hr />
<h2><a name="ContextManagement" id="ContextManagement"></a>5.
Context Management</h2>
<p><tt>InputContext</tt> instances manage communication contexts
between client components and input methods. The main task of an
input context is to maintain the connection from the current client
component to its current input method. It dispatches input events
such as key and mouse events from the component to the current
input method, and input method events from the input method to the
client component. It also dispatches requests for information from
the input method to the client component.</p>
<p>Each <tt>InputContext</tt> instance provides its own text input
environment, separate from all other input contexts. This allows
applications to support multiple concurrent input operations. For
example, in the middle of entering text into a document, a user can
open a file dialog and enter a file name, without affecting the
composition state of the text being entered into the document.</p>
<p>By default, one <tt>InputContext</tt> instance is created per
Window instance, and this input context is shared by all components
within the window's containment hierarchy. If necessary, components
can create private input contexts. A component that doesn't have
its own input context uses the one used by its parent. An input
context has at most one current client component, the component
that currently has the focus. When switching to a new client
component, the input context calls its <tt><a href=
"../../../api/java/awt/im/InputContext.html#endComposition--">endComposition</a></tt>
method to commit or cancel composed text for the previous client
component.</p>
<p>The input context creates an input method instance for each
input method engine that its client components need to use.
Separate input method instances are created for each input context
instance. The instances are kept until the input context is
disposed, so that the instances can keep information about the text
that was entered in the window.</p>
<p>The input context also handles input method selection and the
composition window.</p>
<h3><a name="SelectingInputMethods" id=
"SelectingInputMethods"></a>Selecting Input Methods</h3>
<p>An input context has a current input method and a current
locale.</p>
<p>The input method framework provides two separate ways of
selecting input methods and input locales:</p>
<ul>
<li>The method <tt><a href=
"../../../api/java/awt/im/InputContext.html#selectInputMethod-java.util.Locale-">
InputContext.selectInputMethod</a></tt> lets applications request
an input method supporting a specified locale.</li>
<li>A user interface lets the user request an input method by name,
and specify the input locale. A selection made from the user
interface affects the currently active input context only.</li>
</ul>
<p>The framework does not give preference to selections made either
way, so the last successful selection made either way for an input
context determines the current input method for an input context
(note that <tt>selectInputMethod</tt> may fail if no available
input method supports the requested locale).</p>
<p>Before switching to a new input method, the input context calls
the old input method's <tt>endComposition</tt> method. The input
context retains the old input method instance and reuses it when
the same input method is selected again for this input context at a
later point.</p>
<p><tt>InputContext.selectInputMethod</tt> looks for an input
method supporting the specified locale using the results of the
<tt>InputMethodDescriptor.getAvailableLocales</tt> methods of all
installed input methods. If the user has previously selected an
input method with the specified locale from the user interface,
this input method is chosen. Otherwise it is implementation
dependent which input method is chosen if multiple input methods
support the specified locale.</p>
<p>The user interface for selecting input methods is implementation
dependent. It must provide the user with a list of all available
input methods and let him/her select one of them. Where an input
method supports multiple locales, the user interface also lets the
user select the input locale (this facility may be omitted for host
adapters if the host provides an alternative facility to select the
input locale). Licensees developing Java runtime environments for
their own platforms are encouraged to integrate the user interface
with existing user interfaces for selecting keyboards or input
methods.</p>
<p>On Windows and Solaris
(with Motif-based AWT), the user interface consists of three parts:
a "Select Input Method" menu item added to the Window menu in Motif
or the System menu in Windows, a user-defined input method
selection key, and a pop-up menu brought up by either the "Select
Input Method" menu item or the input method selection key. The
"Select Input Method" item is only shown if the Java runtime
environment has more than one input method available or the input
method supports multiple locales (the host input method adapter is
treated as a single input method). The popup menu lists the
available input methods, with supported locales of multi-locale
input methods as submenus, and lets the user select from this list.
The JREs for Solaris (with <a href=
"../awt/1.5/xawt.html">X-based AWT</a>) and Linux do not provide
the "Select Input Method" menu item, i.e., the pop up menu is only
brought up by pressing the input method selection key. The input
method selection key definition is stored persistently using two
preferences, one defining the base key code value and the other
defining the modifiers. The "modifiers" preference is optional. If
a modifiers entry is defined without matching keyCode entry, that
modifiers entry is ignored. The following table shows the
contents.</p>

<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" summary=
"keys and values">
<tr>
<th id="h1">
<p>key name (String)</p>
</th>
<th id="h2">
<p>value (int)</p>
</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td headers="h1">
"keyCode"
</td>
<td headers="h2">
any java.awt.event.KeyEvent.VK_* value except
VK_UNDEFINED
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td headers="h1">
"modifiers"
</td>
<td headers="h2">
<p>any combination of java.awt.event.InputEvent.*_MASK</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The JRE looks for these preferences first in the
user's preference tree node /java/awt/im/selectionKey, then, if no
definition could be found, in the system preference node with the
same path.</p>
<h3><a name="CompositionWindow" id=
"CompositionWindow"></a>Composition Window</h3>
<p>For passive clients and for active clients using below-the-spot
input, the input method framework provides a composition window.
The window is opened when the input method starts sending composed
text; it is closed when all text is committed. At most one
composition window is open at any time even if multiple
compositions (using separate input contexts) are currently in
progress.</p>
<p>For below-the-spot input, the window is automatically positioned
just below the insertion point where text will be inserted after
being committed. The window's location is calculated first when the
window is opened, then updated whenever committed text has been
dispatched to the client component. If positioning the window below
the insertion point would move it partially or entirely off-screen,
it is moved above the insertion point.</p>
<hr />
<h2><a name="InformationFlowThroughtheFramework" id=
"InformationFlowThroughtheFramework"></a>6. Information Flow
Through the Framework</h2>
<p>The framework provides two mechanisms to communicate information
between the current client component and the current input
method:</p>
<ul>
<li>AWT events are used to pass information about user actions to
the input method, and to notify the component of changes in the
input text. This provides a programming interface that's consistent
with other input operations. However, <tt>InputMethodEvents</tt>
are typically dispatched synchronously to the component's methods,
while other AWT events are dispatched asynchronously through the
event queue.</li>
<li>The <tt>InputMethodRequests</tt> interface defines methods that
an input method can call to request information from the client
component. This invocation is synchronous.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both event dispatching and calling <tt>InputMethodRequests</tt>
methods are done indirectly through the input context. This lets
the input context redirect information to a composition window if
necessary. The composition window provides a full implementation of
an active client, and so the input method can always assume it is
interacting with an active client.</p>
<p>The following sections show the flow of events through the input
method framework and explain the associated handling of input
method requests. Four alternatives are described, depending on the
kind of client component and the selected input style. All diagrams
assume an input method implemented in the Java programming language
using the input method engine SPI. Event flows for peered text
components or native input methods are implementation dependent,
may vary substantially, and are not shown.</p>
<h3>Active Clients With On-the-Spot Input</h3>
<img src="eventflow-active-ots.gif" alt=
"The following context describes this graphic" width="427" height=
"247" align="bottom" />
<p>Input events such as <tt>KeyEvent</tt> and <tt>MouseEvent</tt>
are sent to the current input method through the
<tt>InputContext</tt> object. If the input method uses the event
for text composition, it marks the event consumed and generates an
input method event to the component. The client component must have
registered an <tt>InputMethodListener</tt> so it can handle
<tt>InputMethodEvent</tt>s coming from the input method and receive
composed and committed text.</p>
<p><tt>InputMethodRequests</tt> calls from the input method are
forwarded to the object returned by the client component's
<tt><a href=
"../../../api/java/awt/Component.html#getInputMethodRequests--">getInputMethodRequests</a></tt>
method.</p>
<h3>Active Clients With Below-the-Spot Input</h3>

<h3><img src="eventflow-active-bts.gif" alt=
"The following context describes this graphic" width="427" height=
"247" align="bottom" /></h3>

<p>Input events such as <tt>KeyEvent</tt> and <tt>MouseEvent</tt>
are sent to the current input method through the
<tt>InputContext</tt> object. If the input method uses the event
for text composition, it marks the event consumed and generates an
input method event. Since below-the-spot input is selected, the
event is redirected to the composition window, which handles it.
When text is committed (partially or entirely), the composition
window generates a new input method event holding the committed
text for the client component. The client component must have
registered an <tt>InputMethodListener</tt> so it can handle
<tt>InputMethodEvent</tt>s, which in this case come from the
composition window and only contain committed text.</p>
<p><tt>InputMethodRequests</tt> calls from the input method that
relate to the display of composed text (<tt>getTextLocation</tt>,
<tt>getLocationOffset</tt>) are handled by the composition window;
all others are forwarded to the object returned by the client
component's <tt><a href=
"../../../api/java/awt/Component.html#getInputMethodRequests--">getInputMethodRequests</a></tt>
method. The composition window uses the client component's
<tt>getTextLocation</tt> implementation to position itself.</p>
<h3>Passive Clients</h3>
<img src="eventflow-passive.gif" alt=
"The following context describes this graphic" width="427" height=
"247" align="bottom" />
<p>Input events such as <tt>KeyEvent</tt> and <tt>MouseEvent</tt>
are sent to the current input method through the
<tt>InputContext</tt> object. If the input method uses the event
for text composition, it marks the event consumed and generates an
input method event. The event is redirected to the composition
window, which handles it. When text is committed, the composition
window translates it into key events for the actual client's key
event listener. Only KEY_TYPED events are sent.</p>
<p><tt>InputMethodRequests</tt> calls from the input method are
handled by the composition window. Calls hat relate to the display
of composed text (<tt>getTextLocation</tt>,
<tt>getLocationOffset</tt>) are handled based on information about
the composed text being displayed. All other calls are handled at
all times based on the assumption that composition has just started
and there's no committed text, because the composition window does
not have access to text in the client component.</p>
<h3>Non-Clients</h3>
<img src="eventflow-non.gif" alt=
"The following context describes this graphic" width="427" height=
"67" align="bottom" />
<p>Events for non-clients do not go to the input context. All
events go straight to the component's listeners (here, the key
listener).</p>
