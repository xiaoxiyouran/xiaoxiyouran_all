About City Input Method</h2>
<p>City Input Method is a simple input method that lets users enter
city names by just typing a three-character airport code and
converting it to a corresponding city name. If the user enters more
than one airport code (up to three at a time are possible), the
input method creates a short phrase such as "From San Francisco to
Beijing via Tokyo". For each city, the input method knows the city
names and phrases in a number of different languages (or, more
precisely, locales). City names and phrases in all supported
languages can be freely mixed in any input operation. The input
method can be used to enter text into any text component that
supports input methods, such as a Swing text component.</p>
<hr />
<h2><a name="InstallingandSelectingtheInputMethod" id=
"InstallingandSelectingtheInputMethod"></a>2. Installing and
Selecting the Input Method</h2>
<p>To make the input method available to applications, its jar file
must be installed into the extensions directory of a JRE environment. After launching a Java application with a text
component that supports input methods, the input method can be
selected using the input method selection user interface provided
by the runtime environment. First, make sure that a text component
has the focus - typically, the text component indicates this by
showing an insertion point. Then, choose the "Select Input Method" menu from the menu
that can be pulled down from the top left corner of the window (the
System menu on Windows, Window menu on Solaris), then choose "City
Input Method" and the desired locale from the popup menu. Note that
correct text display in some languages depends on the font
configuration, so you may want to pick the locale of the host
operating system or a language that is supported by most fonts,
such as English or German.</p>
<hr />
<h2><a name="UsingtheInputMethodfortheFirstTime" id=
"UsingtheInputMethodfortheFirstTime"></a>3. Using the Input Method
for the First Time</h2>
<p>After selecting the input method, type "SFO", the code for San
Francisco International Airport. You will see that the text is
input into the text component, but highlighted to indicate that it
is still being composed (the
text is inverted on Solaris, underlined on Windows). Then type a
Space character to start conversion. You will see that the airport
code is replaced with the name of San Francisco in the language
that you selected. The text is still highlighted, although the
highlight may now look somewhat different. Type Space again. A
lookup window opens, which shows the city name in all available
languages, with the originally displayed name selected. Continue
typing Space. You will see that the selection cycles through all
the names, and that the selected name is also shown in the text
component. Type Return. The lookup window disappears, and the most
recently selected name is now shown in the text component without
any highlight - it is committed.</p>

Using the Input Method</h2>
<h3>Entering Raw Text</h3>
<p>Raw text is any text that is entered through the input method,
but hasn't been converted yet. From the moment you type the first
character of an airport until you start conversion the input method
is in raw text mode. In this mode, letters from "a" to "z" or their
uppercase variants (the input method is case insensitive) are added
to the raw text input. You can use backspace to delete a character,
and you can click into the text using the mouse to move the
insertion point.</p>
<h3>Converting to City Names</h3>
<p>You can start the conversion process from airport codes to city
names when the raw text includes one, two, or three airport codes -
that is, three, six, or nine characters. To start conversion, type
Space. A single airport code is converted to just a city name. Two
or three airport codes are converted to phrases such as "From San
Francisco to Frankfurt" for two codes or "From San Francisco to
Frankfurt via Chicago" for three codes. Each city name is
considered a separate segment. One of the segments is selected,
that is, it can be further converted using the lookup window. If
there are multiple segments, the segment selection can be changed
by clicking into a segment or by using the Arrow Right and Arrow
Left keys.</p>
<h3>Continuing Conversion Using the Lookup Window</h3>
<p>The lookup window is a temporary window that shows the city
names in all available languages for the airport code of the
selected segment, and lets the user choose a different name. To
show the window, select a segment, then type Space. The window
opens just below or, if there's not enough space, in another
location near the segment's text. The currently selected city name
is outlined. To change the name selection, type Space, Arrow Down,
or Arrow Up to cycle through all available names. To confirm a
selected name, you usually commit as described in the next section.
To select a name and close the lookup window without committing,
type the number in front of the desired name.</p>
<h3>Committing the Input</h3>
<p>Committing the input text means to end input method processing
of it, and make it a normal part of the text component's text body.
All input method highlighting is removed from committed text. You
can commit the entire input text at any time by typing Return. If
you entered more than one airport code and have started conversion,
you can also perform a partial commit: typing Control-Arrow Down
commits the text up to the currently selected segment, but leaves
following segments available for further conversion.</p>
<p>Conversion is requested using the Space character. During
conversion, the input method first offers the city name in the
selected language (if that name is available). If the user does not
accept this selection, a second step brings up a choice window that
offers all available names for the city, with the corresponding
locale name.</p>
<hr />
<h2><a name="ControllingtheStatusWindow" id=
"ControllingtheStatusWindow"></a>5. Controlling the Status
Window</h2>
<p>The input method provides a little status window that shows the
currently selected locale. Initially this window is positioned near
the lower right corner of the screen, but it can be moved to a
different location. To request that the status window automatically
positions itself below the window containing the currently focussed
text component, double-click into the status window's content
area.</p>
<hr />
<h2><a name="SupportedCitiesandLocales" id=
"SupportedCitiesandLocales"></a>6. Supported Cities and
Locales</h2>
<p>The input method's knowledge of the world is limited - airport
codes it knows include: SFO, NYC, JFK, LGA, ORD, FRA, MUC, TYO,
NRT, HND, KIX, ITM, PEK, BJS, SHA, HKG, TPE. It currently supports
the following languages: English, German, Japanese (normal and
yomi), Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese.</p>
