<h2><a name="Introduction" id="Introduction"></a>1.
Introduction</h2>
<p>The input method engine SPI enables the development of input
methods in the Java programming language that can be used with any
JRE. As far as the input method framework is
concerned, an input method consists of two classes implementing the
<code>InputMethodDescriptor</code> and <code>InputMethod</code>
interfaces, packaged with some additional information as an
extension and installed into a Java runtime. The specifications for
the <code><a href=
"../../../api/java/awt/im/spi/package-summary.html#package_specification">
java.awt.im.spi</a></code> package, and the <code><a href=
"../../../api/java/awt/im/spi/InputMethodDescriptor.html">InputMethodDescriptor</a></code>
and <code><a href=
"../../../api/java/awt/im/spi/InputMethod.html">InputMethod</a></code>
interfaces provide the core information that's needed to implement
an input method. This tutorial provides additional information that
makes this task a little easier and helps avoid compatibility
problems between different implementations of the Java platform.</p>
<hr />
<h2><a name="DescribingtheInputMethod" id=
"DescribingtheInputMethod"></a>2. Describing the Input Method</h2>
<p>Before the input method framework can start using an input
method, it needs to know about its capabilities. The necessary
information is provided by the input method's implementation of the
<code><a href=
"../../../api/java/awt/im/spi/InputMethodDescriptor.html">InputMethodDescriptor</a></code>
class. This information is used in <a href=
"spec.html#SelectingInputMethods">selecting input methods</a>.</p>
<p>The list of available locales returned by <code><a href=
"../../../api/java/awt/im/spi/InputMethodDescriptor.html#getAvailableLocales--">
getAvailableLocales</a></code> should only return languages that
the input method is really designed for. For example, a Chinese
Pinyin input method that produces simplified Chinese characters
should only return <code><a href=
"../../../api/java/util/Locale.html#SIMPLIFIED_CHINESE">SIMPLIFIED_CHINESE</a></code>,
even if it has a mode that simply lets key events pass through and
thus also makes it possible to write English or Malay. The
<code><a href=
"../../../api/java/awt/im/spi/InputMethod.html#setLocale-java.util.Locale-">
InputMethod.setLocale</a></code> method on the other hand may
return true for a larger set of languages. The reason is that
<code>getAvailableLocales</code> is used to decide whether to load
and switch <em>to</em> an input method, which is only worthwhile if
the input method handles the language well, while
<code>setLocale</code> is used to decide whether to switch
<em>away</em> from an input method, which is only worthwhile if the
input method doesn't handle the language at all.</p>
<hr />
<h2><a name="CommunicatingwiththeClientComponent" id=
"CommunicatingwiththeClientComponent"></a>3. Communicating with the
Client Component</h2>
<p>When an input method instance is created, it receives an
<code><a href=
"../../../api/java/awt/im/spi/InputMethodContext.html">InputMethodContext</a></code>
instance through <code><a href=
"../../../api/java/awt/im/spi/InputMethod.html#setInputMethodContext-java.awt.im.spi.InputMethodContext-">
setInputMethodContext</a></code>. This instance provides it with
all the functionality that it needs to communicate with the input
method framework, the client component, or the composition window.
It lets the input method send information about composed and
committed text using the <code><a href=
"../../../api/java/awt/im/spi/InputMethodContext.html#dispatchInputMethodEvent-int-java.text.AttributedCharacterIterator-int-java.awt.font.TextHitInfo-java.awt.font.TextHitInfo-">
dispatchInputMethodEvent</a></code> method. And it lets the input
method request information from the client component using the
methods it inherits from the <code><a href=
"../../../api/java/awt/im/InputMethodRequests.html">InputMethodRequests</a></code>
interface.</p>
<p>The input method framework provides the input method with an
environment that makes it seem like it is always communicating with
an <a href="spec.html#ClientComponents">active client</a> component
using the on-the-spot <a href="spec.html#InputStyles">input
style</a>. If the actual client component is not an active client,
or if a different input style is used, then the framework <a href=
"spec.html#InformationFlowThroughtheFramework">redirects</a> events
and requests as needed.</p>
<p>The input method should never try to access the client component
directly, as doing so would conflict with the framework's switching
and redirection functionality. Instead, the input method should
always use the methods provided by its input method context.</p>
<hr />
<h2><a name="UsingInputMethodWindows" id=
"UsingInputMethodWindows"></a>4. Using Input Method Windows</h2>
<p>Input methods may use a number of different windows to
communicate with the user. Windows commonly used by input methods
include:</p>
<ul>
<li>a <em>look-up window</em>, which shows several possible
interpretations of the user's input and lets the user choose the
correct one.</li>
<li>a <em>status window</em>, which provides the user with
information about the current state of the input method, such as
the selected language or target character set.</li>
<li>a <em>control panel</em> (often combined with the status
window), which lets the user change the input method's state, such
as selecting a different language or target character set.</li>
<li>a <em>preferences window</em>, which lets the user tailor the
input method to his or her needs.</li>
<li>a <em>dictionary editor window</em>, which lets the user add or
correct conversions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: On some other platforms, input methods may also provide a
composition window, which shows the composed text. In the Java
input method framework, composed text is always displayed by the
client component or the input method framework, never by the input
method.</p>
<p>It is useful to consider three groups of windows:</p>
<ul>
<li>transient windows: these windows pop up for short times during
a composition operation. Their functionality is tied to a specific
composition. Opening, closing, positioning, and sizing are usually
automatic since any user interaction with the windows themselves
would distract from the composition. In particular, transient
windows are always closed when the composition operation ends or is
interrupted. Examples: look-up window.</li>
<li>persistent windows: these windows tend to stay around for
extended periods of time, possibly for as long as the user is using
the input method. Their functionality may be tied to the currently
active instance of the input method, or to the input method class.
Usually the user can actively open, close, position, and possibly
resize these windows, although they are always automatically closed
when switching to a different input method, and in some cases
they're automatically positioned relative to the window containing
the current client component. Examples: status window, control
panel.</li>
<li>document windows: these are just regular windows. Their
functionality is not tied to composition. The user fully controls
opening, closing, positioning, and possibly sizing of these
windows. Examples: dictionary editor window.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's how these window groups can be handled by input methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>transient windows are created using <code><a href=
"../../../api/java/awt/im/spi/InputMethodContext.html#createInputMethodWindow-java.lang.String-boolean-">
InputMethodContext.createInputMethodWindow</a></code>, typically
with <code>attachToInputContext</code> set to true. They are opened
either in the input method's implementation of <code><a href=
"../../../api/java/awt/im/spi/InputMethod.html#activate--">activate</a></code>,
or later when needed to respond to user input. They are closed in
the input method's implementations of <code><a href=
"../../../api/java/awt/im/spi/InputMethod.html#deactivate-boolean-">
deactivate</a></code> or <code><a href=
"../../../api/java/awt/im/spi/InputMethod.html#hideWindows--">hideWindows</a></code>,
or earlier if they are no longer needed.</li>
<li>persistent windows are created using <code><a href=
"../../../api/java/awt/im/spi/InputMethodContext.html#createInputMethodWindow-java.lang.String-boolean-">
InputMethodContext.createInputMethodWindow</a></code>, with
<code>attachToInputContext</code> set to false. They are typically
opened in the input method's implementation of <code><a href=
"../../../api/java/awt/im/spi/InputMethod.html#activate--">activate</a></code>
and closed in the input method's implementation of <code><a href=
"../../../api/java/awt/im/spi/InputMethod.html#hideWindows--">hideWindows</a></code>.</li>
<li>document windows are created as regular AWT windows, and
opening and closing them is usually under user control.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the focus behavior of a window created by
<code>createInputMethodWindow</code> is implementation dependent.
It may never get the focus, it may get the focus when initially
made visible, or it may get the focus when the user clicks into it.
An input method must be able to handle either case.</p>
<p>To position windows (such as the look-up window) automatically
relative to the composed text, the input method can use the input
method context's <code><a href=
"../../../api/java/awt/im/InputMethodRequests.html#getTextLocation-java.awt.font.TextHitInfo-">
getTextLocation</a></code> method. To position windows (such as a
status window) automatically relative to the window containing the
current client component, the input method can register for
notifications about that window's location and state using the
input method context's <code><a href=
"../../../api/java/awt/im/spi/InputMethodContext.html#enableClientWindowNotification-java.awt.im.spi.InputMethod-boolean-">
enableClientWindowNotification</a></code> method; it then has to
implement the <code><a href=
"../../../api/java/awt/im/spi/InputMethod.html#notifyClientWindowChange-java.awt.Rectangle-">
notifyClientWindowChange</a></code> method to receive
notifications.</p>
<p>Input methods must call <a href=
"../../../api/java/awt/Window.html#dispose--">Window.dispose</a>
for all windows they create when they are no longer needed. This
ensures that the JVM exits when the application terminates all
non-daemon threads it started. Please refer to <a href=
"../../../api/java/awt/doc-files/AWTThreadIssues.html">AWT
Threading Issues</a> for more information.</p>
<hr />
<h2><a name="ImplementingComposition" id=
"ImplementingComposition"></a>5. Implementing Composition</h2>
<p>The main task of an input method is interpreting user actions in
composing text input. The user actions may be typing on the
keyboard, using the mouse, handwriting, or speaking.</p>
<p>The <code><a href=
"../../../api/java/awt/im/spi/InputMethod.html#activate--">activate</a></code>
and <code><a href=
"../../../api/java/awt/im/spi/InputMethod.html#deactivate-boolean-">
deactivate</a></code> methods indicate to the input method whether
a client component has the focus and therefore is the target of
text input. Typically input methods only process events to compose
text while they're active.</p>
<p>When an input method is active, certain types of events are
dispatched to the input method using the <code><a href=
"../../../api/java/awt/im/spi/InputMethod.html#dispatchEvent-java.awt.AWTEvent-">
dispatchEvent</a></code> method before they are processed by the
client component. The input method decides for each event whether
it wants to handle it. If it does, it marks the event as consumed
so that it is not processed by the client component.</p>
<p><em>Note</em>: For <a href=
"../../../api/java/awt/event/KeyEvent.html">key events</a>, input
methods should use only KEY_TYPED events to obtain information
about characters being entered, and use KEY_PRESSED or KEY_RELEASED
events only to obtain information about function keys that don't
result in KEY_TYPED events. The mapping from key-presses to
characters depends on platforms, hardware, locales, and possibly
other factors, and is best left to the underlying operating
system.</p>
<p>As text is being composed and committed, the input method needs
to inform the client component about all changes so that the client
component can redraw the text. The input method does this by using
<code><a href=
"../../../api/java/awt/im/spi/InputMethodContext.html#dispatchInputMethodEvent-int-java.text.AttributedCharacterIterator-int-java.awt.font.TextHitInfo-java.awt.font.TextHitInfo-">
InputMethodContext.dispatchInputMethodEvent</a></code> to construct
and dispatch input method events to the client component. Depending
on the current event flow model, the input method framework may
redirect the events to its composition window. Dispatching input
method events is the only way for Java input methods to have
composed text displayed.</p>
<p>Composed text is usually marked up with highlight styles that
indicate the current state of the conversion. This is accomplished
by adding attributes to the text using the <code><a href=
"../../../api/java/awt/font/TextAttribute.html#INPUT_METHOD_HIGHLIGHT">
TextAttribute.INPUT_METHOD_HIGHLIGHT</a></code> key and instances
of <code><a href=
"../../../api/java/awt/im/InputMethodHighlight.html">InputMethodHighlight</a></code>
as values. Normally input methods only define abstract highlights
(using the state and selected properties of the input method
highlight) and leave the mapping to concrete styles to the
rendering system. However, if desired, input methods can add
concrete style information to the highlight using the style
property. It is a good idea to design the concrete styles as
variations of the styles provided returned by <code><a href=
"../../../api/java/awt/Toolkit.html#mapInputMethodHighlight-java.awt.im.InputMethodHighlight-">
Toolkit.mapInputMethodHighlight</a></code>.</p>
<p>Both the client component and the input method framework may
recognize situations where the current composition needs to be
ended and all composed text either committed or cancelled. They
inform the input method about this need using the <code><a href=
"../../../api/java/awt/im/spi/InputMethod.html#endComposition--">endComposition</a></code>
method. Note that <code>endComposition</code> may be called while
the input method is not active.</p>
<p>Client components can influence composition using several
methods. The <code><a href=
"../../../api/java/awt/im/InputContext.html#setCharacterSubsets-java.lang.Character.Subset:A-">
InputContext.setCharacterSubsets</a></code> method lets them
restrict the subset of the Unicode character set that the input
method is allowed to input. Input methods should generally not
create characters outside of the specified subsets, and may switch
to a different input mode that particularly supports the specified
character subsets. The <code><a href=
"../../../api/java/awt/im/InputContext.html#setCompositionEnabled-boolean-">
InputContext.setCompositionEnabled</a></code> and <code><a href=
"../../../api/java/awt/im/InputContext.html#isCompositionEnabled--">
isCompositionEnabled</a></code> methods let them control and
examine whether the current input method is enabled for
composition. The <code><a href=
"../../../api/java/awt/im/InputContext.html#reconvert--">InputContext.reconvert</a></code>
method lets them initiate reconversion.</p>
<hr />
<h2><a name="ProvidingEngine-SpecificFunctionality" id=
"ProvidingEngine-SpecificFunctionality"></a>6. Providing
Engine-Specific Functionality</h2>
<p>Some input methods may want to provide functionality to client
components that can not be made available through the input method
framework API. This is possible through <em>input method control
objects</em>. The input method developer must publish an interface
for these objects, and return instances through <code><a href=
"../../../api/java/awt/im/spi/InputMethod.html#getControlObject--">InputMethod.getControlObject</a></code>.
Client components that want to take advantage of the additional
functionality can then call <code><a href=
"../../../api/java/awt/im/InputContext.html#getInputMethodControlObject--">
InputContext.getInputMethodControlObject</a></code>, check whether
the returned object is an instance of a known control object class,
and if it is, call its methods.</p>
<hr />
<h2><a name="PackagingtheInputMethod" id=
"PackagingtheInputMethod"></a>7. Packaging the Input Method</h2>
<p>Input methods are packaged as installed extensions with specific
content as described in the <a href=
"../../../api/java/awt/im/spi/package-summary.html#Packaging">"Packaging
Input Methods"</a> section of the SPI specification. One important
aspect to consider is that all extensions installed in a Java
application environment share the same name space. To avoid name
collisions, input methods should follow the package naming
conventions as described in the Java Language Specification.
Similar conventions should be applied to naming non-class files
that are packaged in the input method JAR file, such as
dictionaries.</p>
