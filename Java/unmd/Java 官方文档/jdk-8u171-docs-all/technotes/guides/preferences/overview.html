<h1>Preferences API Overview</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>All of the methods that modify preference data are permitted to
operate asynchronously. They may return immediately, and changes
will eventually propagate to the persistent backing store. The
<a href=
"../../../api/java/util/prefs/Preferences.html#flush--">flush</a>
method can be used to force updates to the backing store.</p>
<p>The methods in the <a href=
"../../../api/java/util/prefs/Preferences.html">Preferences
class</a> may be invoked concurrently by multiple threads in a
single JVM without the need for external synchronization, and the
results will be equivalent to some serial execution. If this class
is used concurrently by multiple JVMs that store their preference
data in the same backing store, the data store will not be
corrupted, but no other guarantees are made concerning the
consistency of the preference data.</p>

<h3><a name="prefs-other" id="prefs-other"></a>Comparing
Preferences API to Other Mechanisms</h3>
<p>Prior to the introduction of the Preferences API, developers
could choose to manage preference and configuration data in an ad
hoc fashion, by using the Properties API or the JNDI API as
described below.</p>
<p>Often, preference and configuration data was stored in
properties files, accessed through the java.util.Properties API.
However, there are no standards as to where such files should
reside on disk, or what they should be called. Using this
mechanism, it is extremely difficult to backup a user's preference
data, or transfer it from one machine to another. As the number of
applications increases, the possibility of file name conflicts
increases. Also, this mechanism is of no help on platforms that
lack a local disk, or where it is desirable that the data be stored
in an external data store (such as an enterprise-wide LDAP
directory service).</p>
<p>Less frequently, developers stored user preference and
configuration data in a directory service, accessed through the
Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) API. Unlike the
Properties API, JNDI allows the use of arbitrary data stores
(back-end neutrality). While JNDI is extremely powerful, it is also
rather large, consisting of 5 packages and 83 classes. JNDI
provides no policy as to where in the directory name space the
preference data should be stored, or in which name space.</p>
<p>Neither Properties nor JNDI provide a simple, ubiquitous,
back-end neutral preferences management facility. The Preferences
API does provide such a facility, combining the simplicity of
Properties with the back-end neutrality of JNDI. It provides
sufficient built-in policy to prevent name clashes, foster
consistency, and encourage robustness in the face of
inaccessibility of the backing data store.</p>

<h2><a name="prefs-usage" id="prefs-usage"></a>Usage Notes</h2>
<p>The material contained in this section is not part of the
Preferences API specification, instead it is intended to provide
some examples of how the Preferences API might be used.</p>

for an Enclosing Class</a></li>
<li><a href="#prefs-usage-static">Obtaining Preferences Objects for
a Static Method</a></li>

</ul>
<h3><a name="prefs-usage-enclosing" id=
"prefs-usage-enclosing"></a>Obtaining Preferences Objects for an
Enclosing Class</h3>
<p>The following examples illustrate how you might obtain the
Preferences objects (system and user) pertaining to the enclosing
class. These examples would work only inside instance methods.</p>
<p>Note that static final fields, rather than inline String
literals, are used for the key names (<code>NUM_ROWS</code> and
<code>NUM_COLS</code>). This reduces the likelihood of runtime bugs
from typographical errors in key names.</p>
<p>Note also that reasonable defaults are provided for each of the
preference values obtained. These defaults will be returned if no
preference value has been set, or if the backing store is
inaccessible.</p>
<pre>
package com.acme.widget;
import  java.util.prefs.*;

public class Gadget {
    // Preference keys for this package
    private static final String NUM_ROWS = "num_rows";
    private static final String NUM_COLS = "num_cols";

    void foo() {
        Preferences prefs = Preferences.userNodeForPackage(Gadget.class);

        int numRows = prefs.getInt(NUM_ROWS, 40);
        int numCols = prefs.getInt(NUM_COLS, 80);

        ...
    }
}
</pre>
<p>The above example obtains per-user preferences. If a single,
per-system value were desired, the first line in <code>foo</code>
would be replaced by:</p>
<pre>
        Preferences prefs = Preferences.systemNodeForPackage(Gadget.class);
</pre>
<h3><a name="prefs-usage-static" id=
"prefs-usage-static"></a>Obtaining Preferences Objects for a Static
Method</h3>
<p>The examples in the prior section illustrate obtaining
Preferences objects pertaining to the enclosing class, and work
inside instance methods. In a static method (or static
initializer), you need to explicitly provide the name of the
package:</p>
<pre>
    Static String ourNodeName = "/com/acme/widget";

    static void foo() {
        Preferences prefs = Preferences.userRoot().node(ourNodeName);

        ...
    }
</pre>
<p>It is always acceptable to obtain a system preferences object
once, in a static initializer, and use it whenever system
preferences are required:</p>
<pre>
    static Preferences prefs =  Preferences.systemRoot().node(ourNodeName);
</pre>
<p>In general, it is acceptable to do the same thing for a user
preferences object, but not if the code in question is to be used
in a server, wherein multiple users will be running concurrently or
serially. In such a system, <code>userNodeForPackage</code> and
<code>userRoot</code> will return the appropriate node for the
calling user, thus it's critical that calls to
<code>userNodeForPackage</code> or <code>userRoot</code> be made
from the appropriate thread at the appropriate time. If a piece of
code may eventually be used in such a server environment, it is
good, conservative practice to obtain user preferences objects
immediately before they are used, as in the <a href=
"#prefs-usage-static">prior example</a>.</p>
<h3><a name="prefs-usage-atomic" id="prefs-usage-atomic"></a>Atomic
Updates</h3>
<p>The preferences API does not provide database like
"transactions" wherein multiple preferences are modified
atomically. Occasionally, it is necessary to modify two or more
preferences as a unit. For example, suppose you are storing the x
and y coordinates where a window is to be placed. The only way to
achieve atomicity is to store both values in a single preference.
Many encodings are possible. Here's a simple one:</p>
<pre>
    int x, y;
    ...
    prefs.put(POSITION, x + "," + y);
</pre>
<p>When such a "compound preference" is read, it must be decoded.
For robustness, allowances should be made for a corrupt
(unparseable) value:</p>
<pre>
    static int X_DEFAULT = 50, Y_DEFAULT = 25;
    void baz() {
        String position = prefs.get(POSITION, X_DEFAULT + "," + Y_DEFAULT);
        int x, y;
        try {
            int i = position.indexOf(',');
            x = Integer.parseInt(coordinates.substring(0, i));
            y = Integer.parseInt(position.substring(i + 1));
        } catch(Exception e) {
            // Value was corrupt, just use defaults
            x = X_DEFAULT;
            y = Y_DEFAULT;
        }
        ...
    }
</pre>
<h3><a name="prefs-usage-backingstore" id=
"prefs-usage-backingstore"></a>Determining Backing Store
Status</h3>
<p>Typical application code has no need to know whether the backing
store is available. It should almost always be available, but if it
isn't, the code should continue to execute using default values in
place of preference values from the backing store. Very rarely,
some advanced program might want to vary its behavior (or simply
refuse to run) if the backing store were unavailable. Following is
a method that determines whether the backing store is available by
attempting to modify a preference value and flush the result to the
backing store.</p>
<pre>
    private static final String BACKING_STORE_AVAIL = "BackingStoreAvail";

    private static boolean backingStoreAvailable() {
        Preferences prefs = Preferences.userRoot().node("&lt;temporary&gt;");
        try {
            boolean oldValue = prefs.getBoolean(BACKING_STORE_AVAIL, false);
            prefs.putBoolean(BACKING_STORE_AVAIL, !oldValue);
            prefs.flush();
        } catch(BackingStoreException e) {
            return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
</pre>
