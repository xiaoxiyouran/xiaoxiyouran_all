<h2>March 2006 Updates:</h2>
<h2>General Questions</h2>
<div style="margin-left: 2em;">
<p><a name="s101" id="s101"></a><b>What is Java Web Start?</b></p>
<p>Java Web Start provides a platform-independent, secure, and
robust deployment technology. It enables developers to deploy
full-featured applications to end-users by making the applications
available on a standard web server. With any web browser, end-users
can launch the applications and be confident they always have the
most-recent version.<br />
<a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
<p><a name="s102" id="s102"></a><b>Where do I get more
information?</b></p>
<p>Look at the online documentation for <a href="../../javaws">Java
Web Start</a> .</p>
<p>If you are a developer, go to the <a href=
"../../javaws/developersguide/contents.html">Developer's
Guide</a> for detailed technical information on how to deploy
applications using Java Web Start.<br />
<a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
<p><a name="s103" id="s103"></a><b>Why should I use Java Web
Start?</b></p>
<p>It's an easy, robust, and secure way to deploy applications
directly from the web. Developers can make applications readily
available via the web. In addition, Java Web Start provides Java
runtime environment (JRE) management capabilities, it's easy to set
up, it's browser-independent, and it's an efficient way to deploy
web application solutions.</p>
<p>Users can easily access applications much as they would a web
page--without a separate installation step. From the desktop, users
can access and use Java applications, using a richer and more
responsive user interface than is available on a web page. And,
once a Java Web Start based application is installed, users simply
click to run the application whenever needed.</p>
<p>Users do not need to manually update applications because each
time they launch an application, it is transparently updated from
the web--so they always use the most recent version
available.<br />
<a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
<p><a name="s104" id="s104"></a><b>How can I launch applications
with Java Web Start?</b></p>
<p>You initially launch a new application by clicking on a link
from a web page.</p>
<p>If you use an application frequently, create a shortcut from
your desktop or from the Start Menu by allowing Java Web Start to
place an icon on your desktop. Java Web Start may ask if you would
like to create<br />
shortcuts or an entry in the Start Menu. If you say
&quot;yes,&quot; all future launches of the application can start
without a browser.</p>
<p>Java Web Start also provides an Application Cache Viewer which
you can launch from the Java Control Panel.&nbsp; The Cache Viewer
enables you to directly launch applications you have
downloaded.</p>
<p>You can also launch an application from a command prompt by
typing &ldquo;javaws &lt;jnlp_url&gt;&rdquo; where &lt;jnlp_url is
a url to the jnlp file of the application.<br />
<a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
<p><a name="s105" id="s105"></a><b>Does it matter how I launch an
application?</b></p>
<p>No, applications launch in the same manner no matter which
method you use: from a web page, from the shortcut on the desktop,
from the Start menu, or through the Java Application Cache
Viewer.</p>
<p>Java Web Start always checks to see if a newer version of the
application is available for use and automatically downloads it if
so.</p>
<p>If the application you are using has not been digitally signed,
Java Web Start will launch it in a restricted and secure execution
environment. An application that is not signed, or one that you do
not trust, will never be run with unrestricted access to your local
system or network.<br />
<a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
<p><a name="s106" id="s106"></a><b>What are the system requirements
for Java Web Start?</b></p>
<p>Any client system that supports the Java version 1.2.2 or higher
can use Java Web Start. Java Web Start works with virtually all
browsers.<br />
<a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
<p><a name="s107" id="s107"></a><b>What platforms does Java Web
Start run on?</b></p>
<p>Sun Microsystems provides versions for Windows
98/NT/2000/XP/2003, Solaris Operating Environment (SPARC and Intel
editions) and Linux/i486. <a href=
"https://developer.apple.com/java">Apple</a> provides a version for
their OS X release.<br />
<a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
<p><a name="s108" id="s108"></a><b>What are the server requirements
for Java Web Start?</b></p>
<p>Java Web Start uses HTTP for communication between the client
and the server. You can use a standard web server to host an
application. If you require additional services, such as
version-based downloading, incremental updates, or pack200
compression for your applications, the web server will need to
support servlets or Java Server Pages. A sample servlet
implementing these features is provided in the samples directory of
the JDK.<br />
<a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
<p><a name="s109" id="s109"></a><b>Is Java Web Start based on a
standard?</b></p>
<p>Yes. Java Web Start 1.5.0 is the product-quality reference
implementation of Java Network Launching Protocol (JNLP)
technology, which was developed through the Java Community
Process.&nbsp; JNLP is specification number JSR 056.&nbsp; Other
platform vendors are encouraged to port Java Web Start to their
platform or implement the specification.</p>
<p>For more information, see the <a href=
"http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=56">JNLP
specification</a>.&nbsp;<br />
<a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
<p><a name="s110" id="s110"></a><b>Can I implement my own Java Web
Start?</b></p>
<p>The underlying technology for Java Web Start, the Java Network
Launching Protocol and API is being developed through the Java
Community Process, so you can implement this protocol in any
product. However additional licensing and terms must be met to
implement any JCP technology including the JNLP technology.<br />
<a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
<p><a name="s111" id="s111"></a><b>What are the supported
browsers?</b></p>
<p>Java Web Start supports primarily Internet Explorer 4 or higher
and Mozilla. However any browser can launch JNLP files if you have
set the MIME-type association correctly. Java Web Start uses the
browser's settings and may launch a browser to show a URL; this
feature may not work with unsupported browsers.<br />

<p><a name="s113" id="s113"></a><b>Can I deploy any application
with Java Web Start?</b></p>
<p>Java Web Start is an application launcher for Java applications
that are written to be web-deployed.</p>
<p>An application must be delivered in a set of JAR files and all
application resources, such as images, configuration files, and
native libraries must be included in the JAR files. The resources
must be looked up using the method
<tt>ClassLoader.getResource()</tt> or an equivalent method. Java
Web Start only transfers JAR files from the web server to the
client.</p>
<p>If an application is written to run in a restricted execution
environment (sandbox), then access to disk is not permitted and the
application may only connect to the host on which it resides.<br />
<a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
<p><b>Is Java Web Start a software distribution mechanism like
Marimba and MS SMS?</b></p>
<p>Java Web Start is an application launcher for Java applications.
It allows easy distribution of full-featured applications based on
the Java platform from a web server to a client machine with
minimal user interaction.</p>
<p>The software distribution technology is only one aspect of Java
Web Start. It also provides security, updates to the applications,
ease-of-use for end users, and flexibility for developers when they
create the applications.<br />
<a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
<p><a name="s115" id="s115"></a><a name="s114" id="s114"></a><b>Is
Java Web Start an application installer?</b></p>
<p>Java Web Start is an application launcher for Java applications
that are written to be web-deployed. Java Web Start caches
resources locally on the disk, but also provides a secure execution
environment and a virtually transparent updating facility for
applications. The end user does not need to manually initiate a
software update because the application is updated each time it is
used.<br />
<a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
<p><a name="s116" id="s116"></a><b>What version of the Java
platform does Java Web Start work with?</b></p>
<p>Java Web Start launches only applications written for the Java
platform versions 1.2.2 and higher.<br />
<a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
<p><a name="s117" id="s117"></a><b>How does Java Web Start relate
to Java Plug-in Technology (applets)?</b></p>
<p>The two approaches are very similar. The key difference is in
the user experience. If the Java application/applet needs to
interact with a web page and be tightly bound to a web browser,
then applets may be the solution. On the other hand, if browser
independence is important, then Java Web Start is the deployment
platform of choice. There are a number of other differences, but
this is the fundamental difference.</p>
<p>Java Plug-in technology enables users to run Java applets inside
a browser.</p>
<p>Java Web Start enables users to download full-featured
applications with any browser. Once they have downloaded and
launched an application, the browser can be closed, while the
application continues working. The application does not depend on
an open browser to function. The browser can be shut down or you
can go to a different web page and the application will continue
running.<br />

<h2>Technical Questions</h2>
<div style="margin-left: 2em;">
<p><a name="s201" id="s201"></a><b>Do I need to change my
application to work with Java Web Start?</b></p>
<p>If your application is written to the Java 2 platform, and is
delivered as a set of JAR files, there should be no need to revise
your application.&nbsp; Make sure that your application retrieves
all its resources (such as images and resource bundles) from a JAR
file, since Java Web Start launches an application by invoking the
<tt>public static void main(String[] args)</tt> method.</p>
<p>If your application needs unrestricted access to the system,
(for example, network or disk access), you will need to sign your
code.<br />
<a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
<p><a name="s202" id="s202"></a><b>Is there a migration path from
applets to applications?</b>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Java Web Start is primarily designed for application deployment.
You specify all requirements for your application in the JNLP file,
and off you go. It does provide the ability to launch applets in
much the same way as the traditional AppletViewer. The built-in
AppletViewer provides an easy migration path for existing applets
that want to take advantage of Java Web Start. However, it is not
intended to be a full implementation of the Plug-In. The Plug-In is
the primary launching vehicle for applets. The built-in
AppletViewer in Java Web Start has&nbsp; limitations, for example,
you cannot specify class files as resources and it does not accept
policy files.<br />
<a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
<p><a name="s203" id="s203"></a><b>Is there a way to pass VM
arguments to the Java Runtime?</b></p>
<p>Java Web Start allows certain JVM flags to be set with the
<code>java-vm-args</code> attribute of the <tt>j2se</tt> element
(see <a href=
"../../javaws/developersguide/syntax.html#resources">Developer's
Guide</a>). Allowing the complete set could compromise security as
well as limit portability across different platforms and
implementations. You can set the maximum and initial heap size
using the initial-heap-size and max-heap-size attributes of the
j2se element, for example:</p>
<p>&lt;j2se version=&quot;...&quot;
max-heap-size=&quot;100M&quot;/&gt;</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
<p><a name="s204" id="s204"></a><b>I don't want to rely on a server
timestamp. How can I specify a versioned JAR and how can I get
incremental updates of JARs?</b></p>
<p>Java Web Start supports versioned JARs and incremental updates.
You can specify exact versions of the JAR files you want, instead
of relying on timestamp information to determine if an update is
available. Using version IDs also allows you to provide incremental
updates from one version to another. See the <a href=
"http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=56">JNLP Specification</a> or the
<a href="../../javaws/developersguide/contents.html">
Developer's Guide</a> for details.<br />
<a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
<p><a name="s205" id="s205"></a><b>Are JAR files shared between
applications?</b></p>
<p>Each JAR file that a JNLP Client (such as Java Web Start)
downloads, is uniquely identified with a URL. If two JNLP files use
the same URL, then the resource will only be downloaded once and
shared. This is similar to the caching implementations used by web
browsers.<br />
<a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
<p><a name="s206" id="s206"></a><b>How can I provide my own splash
screen?</b></p>
<p>Java Web Start needs to put up the initial splash screen while
Java is loading. For subsequent access, you can specify an image
file to use for the splash screen in the JNLP file with the tag</p>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">
&lt;icon href=&quot;mysplash.jpg&quot; kind=&quot;splash&quot;/&gt; 
</pre>
<p>where <code>mysplash.jpg</code> is the image file for your
splash screen.&nbsp; The first time your application runs, it will
use the standard splash screen. After that, it will use the image
you provide.<br />
<a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
<p><a name="s207" id="s207"></a><b>How can I save the application
state on the local system?</b></p>
<p>A sandboxed application can store state using the
<tt>PersistenceService</tt> API. This API is similar to cookies for
HTML pages. Thus, it is a secure way to store persistent
information on the client computer.&nbsp; For more information,
see:</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
<p><a name="s208" id="s208"></a><b>My application requires a
specific version of the JRE. How do I specify this my JNLP
file?</b></p>
<p>The tag &lt;j2se version=&quot;versionNum&quot;&gt; specifies a
platform version, where versionNum is 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, or 1.5.</p>
<p>You can request a specific product version by including a vendor
URL in the href attribute. For Oracle's JREs, the URL is <a href="http://javadl.sun.com/webapps/jawsautodl/AutoDL/j2se">http://javadl.sun.com/webapps/jawsautodl/AutoDL/j2se</a>
For example, the following J2SE tag will request any Sun 1.3.1
implementation:</p>
<pre>
&lt;j2se version=&quot;1.3.1*&quot; href=&quot;<a href="http://javadl.sun.com/webapps/jawsautodl/AutoDL/j2se">http://javadl.sun.com/webapps/jawsautodl/AutoDL/j2se</a>&quot;/&gt;
 
</pre>
<p>You can see all the versions of the installed JREs in the Java
tab of the Java Control Panel.<br />
<a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
<p><a name="s209" id="s209"></a><b>Can I rely on Class-Path in the
manifest file?</b></p>
<p>Java Web Start does not support the Class-Path entry in the
manifest file. The Class-Path attribute is entirely file-centric,
whereas Java Web Start and JNLP is web-centric, i.e., based on
URLs. Thus, the two models do not merge easily.</p>
<p>Instead of relying on the Class-Path entry, you can list
multiple JAR files in the JNLP file, for example:</p>
<pre>
&lt;resources&gt;
 &lt;jar href=&quot;A.jar&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;jar href=&quot;B.jar&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/resources&gt;
</pre>
<p>In a JNLP file, you can factor out dependencies on a set of JAR
files to another JNLP file using the <tt>&lt;extension... &gt;</tt>
element. Thus, you can achieve the same kind of re-usability and
ease of maintenance as you do with the Class-Path entry. This
feature is described in the specification.</p>
<p>JNLP also implements a just-in-time downloading mechanism,
similar to applets. For each resource in a JNLP file, you can
specify which parts should be eagerly or lazily downloaded.&nbsp;
Eagerly loaded resources are loaded before the application is
launched, lazily loaded resources later.&nbsp; Default is eager
download. Furthermore, the specification includes an API for which
you can programatically query Java Web Start about which resources
are available and request them to be downloaded. Thus, you can
write download/network aware applications.</p>
<p>See the <a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=56">JNLP
specification</a> for more information.<br />
<a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
<p><a name="s210" id="s210"></a><b>Can I use Java Web Start even if
my application depends on or uses native code?</b></p>
<p>You can use Java Web Start to deploy Java Technology-based
applications that depend on native code such as DLLs and SOs. Use
the <tt>&lt;nativelib ...&gt;</tt> element to specify required
native libraries. See the <a href=
"../../javaws/developersguide/contents.html">Developer's Guide</a> for
details.<br />
<a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
<p><a name="s211" id="s211"></a><b>How can I load resources within
my application using Class.forName and
ClassLoader.getSystemClassLoader?</b></p>
<p>Java Web Start uses a user-level classloader to load all the
application resources specified in the JNLP file. This classloader
implements the security model and the downloading model defined by
the JNLP specification. This is no different than how the
AppletViewer or the Java Plug-In works.</p>
<p>This has the, unfortunate, side-effect that
<tt>Class.forName</tt> will not find any resources that are defined
in the JNLP file. The same is true for looking up resources and
classes using the system class loader
(<tt>ClassLoader.getSystemClassLoader</tt>).</p>
<p>To find application resources in Java Web Start, use the
classloader that loaded your application, for example use the
following call in the in the application;s main thread:</p>
<p><tt>this.getClass().getClassLoader();</tt></p>
<p>You can also use:</p>
<p><tt>Thread.getCurrent().getContextClassLoader();</tt><br />

<p>You can launch Java Web Start from the command line as
follows:</p>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">
javaws [options] <i>your-app-JNLP-URL</i>
</pre>
<p>where your-app-JNLP-URL is the location of your application's

<p><a name="s213" id="s213"></a><b>How do I use multiple JAR files
signed by different certificates?</b></p>
<p>The JNLP 1.0 specification requires all JAR files used in a JNLP
file to be signed by the same certificate. This restriction avoids
requiring the user to accept multiple certificates from the same
source, and enables Java Web Start to know if the user has accepted
all certificates used for an application.</p>
<p>However, Java Web Start can use multiple JAR files signed by
different certificates, by using the component extension mechanism
and multiple JNLP files.&nbsp; The only requirement is that the JAR
files contain code from different packages.&nbsp; So, instead of
the following:</p>
<pre>
&lt;jar href=&quot;myjar1.jar&quot;/&gt;
&lt;jar href=&quot;jh.jar&quot;/&gt; 
</pre>
<p>Use the following:</p>
<pre>
&lt;jar href=&quot;myjar1.jar&quot;/&gt;
&lt;extension name=&quot;Java Help&quot; href=&quot;help.jnlp&quot;/&gt; 
</pre>
<p>Then add a <tt>help.jnlp</tt> file with the following
contents:</p>
<pre>
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;?&gt;
 &lt;jnlp spec=&quot;1.0+&quot;
codebase=&quot;http://ws503&quot; href=&quot;Help.jnlp&quot;&gt;

&lt;title&gt;JavaHelp&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;vendor&gt;Sun Microsystems, Inc.&lt;/vendor&gt;
 &lt;/information&gt;

<p><a name="s214" id="s214"></a><b>How do I detect if Java Web
Start is installed?</b></p>
<p>You can write a short JavaScript or VBScript to detect if Java
Web Start is installed. See the <a href=
"../../javaws/developersguide/contents.html">Developer's Guide</a> for
details.<br />
<a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
<p><a name="s215" id="s215"></a><b>Why does my browser shows JNLP
file as plain text ?</b></p>
<p>This is most likely happening because your web server is not
aware of the proper MIME type for JNLP files. Java Web Start
requires only one change to your web server, that is creating an
association between the file extension, typically jnlp, and the
MIME type, <tt>application/x-java-jnlp-file</tt>. The steps for
doing this vary depending upon the web server you are using.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if your corporation uses a proxy server, ensure
that the update versions of the files are returned, by updating the
time stamp of the resources on the web server such that the proxies
will update their caches.<br />
<a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
<p><a name="s216" id="s216"></a><b>Why does Java Web Start always
reload JAR files from IIS server?</b></p>
<p>If a timestamp of the file on the IIS server is in the future
IIS returns current-time as last-modified time. This makes Java Web
Start to reload the JARs since time-stamp is always newer.<br />
<a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
<p><a name="s217" id="s217"></a><b>Can I use Pack200 compression
with the JnlpDownloadServlet?</b></p>
<p>Yes. The JnlpDownloadServlet
distributed in the samples directory of the JDK now supports
Pack200. If you deploy yourfile.jar along with
yourfile.jar.pack.gz the packed file will be downloaded when the
client is running Java Web Start 1.5.0 or
later.<b><br /></b><a href="#top">Back to
top</a></p>
<p><a name="s218" id="s218"></a><b>What is the best way to ensure
only one instance of my application is run?</b></p>
<p>Use the SingleInstanceService
to register as a singleton as soon as your application starts up.
Re-invoking your application before it is registered as a singleton
will cause another Java VM to start up.</p>
<p>Make sure to unregister before
your program exits.<b><br /></b><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
<p><a name="s219" id="s219"></a><b>When will properties set in the
jnlp file get set?</b></p>
<p>Normally, properties in the
jnlp file will not be set until the first resource listed in that
jnlp file is loaded. This insures the properties are set before any
of your code is run, however some properties need to be set before
other packages are loaded. Some properties are considered to be
&ldquo;secure&rdquo; by Java Web Start, and, when found in the main
jnlp file, will be passed as arguments to the invoking VM
(-Dname=value).</p>
<p>The list of
&ldquo;secure&rdquo; properties for this version can be found in
the <a href="../../javaws/developersguide/syntax.html">Developer's
Guide</a> <b><br /></b><a href="#top">Back to

<p><a name="s220" id="s220"></a><b>What causes the file not found
message for the downloaded jnlp file?</b></p>
<p>You click on a jnlp file, and Internet Explorer downloads the
file, then launches Java Web Start, but you get the message:
&ldquo;Could not load file/URL specified: C:\Documents and
Settings\...\application[1].jnlp&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This problem is specific to
Internet Explorer. Although this can be caused by a full cache, or
turning off the cache in IE, it is usually caused by a no-cache
directive coming from either the web server or the proxy server. IE
will honor this directive, and not write the jnlp file to disk, so
Java Web Start cannot find it. This frequently happens when
upgrading a tomcat based server. Later versions set the no-cache
directive by default for any resource that is within a
security-constraint in web.xml. Try taking the relevant URI out of
the security constraint in web.xml. <b><br /></b><a href=

<p><a name="s221" id="s221"></a><b>How can I use signed jars (such
as JCE extensions) signed for other purposes?</b></p>
<p>Beginning with Java Web Start
1.5.0, you can multiply sign the jar, adding code signing
certificates over another existing certificate chain. With previous
versions, you would either have to run the jar as a component
extension w/o all-permissions, or strip the existing certificates
before adding code signing certificates. (which in many cases
rendered the package inoperable.)<b><br /></b><a href=

<p><a name="s223" id="s223"></a><b>How do I set up my server to
broadcast the jnlp mime type?</b></p>
<p>Each web server has a specific way in which to add MIME types.
For example, for the Apache web server you must add the following
line to the <tt>.mime.types</tt> configuration file:</p>
<p><tt>application/x-java-jnlp-file JNLP</tt></p>
<p>Check the documentation for the specifics of your web server.

the JnlpDownloadServlet?</b></p>

"downloadservletguide.html#using">Developers Guide</a> section on using the servlet. The application
need not be packaged in a Web Archive.<b><br /></b><a href=
"#top">Back to top</a></p>
<p><a name="s225" id="s225"></a><b>How are Applications uniquely
identified?</b></p>
<p>An application is normally
identified by it's href (the url to it's jnlp file.) If there is no
href to the jnlp file, it is identified by the href to it's main
jar file. If multiple applications share the same main jar file,
they must contain an href, or they will be treated as the same
app.</p>
<p>In version 1.5.0 and beyond,
the Java Application Cache Viewer, will show all applications, even
those w/o an href. The Viewer can only launch an application
online, if it has an href. Without an href, it can launch offline
if the jnlp file allows (contains
&lt;offline-allowed&gt;)</p>
<p>In previous versions, the
Application Manager will only show those applications with an
href.</p>
<p>The same thing applies to
creating shortcuts. In 1.5.0 you can only create a shortcut to
launch online if there is an href, and can only create an offline
shortcut if &lt;offline-allowed&gt; is specified. In 1.4.2, you can
only create shortcuts to applications with an
href.<br /><a href="#top">Back to

file-extension/mime-type associations with a JNLP
application?</b></p>
<p>When creating multiple
file-extension/mime-type associations with your JNLP application,
it's recommended that you use multiple association tags. Also, both
the file-extension and mime-type must be specified for each
association tag. For example:</p>
<pre>
    &lt;association extensions="aaa" mime-type="x-application/aaa"/&gt;
    &lt;association extensions="bbb" mime-type="x-application/bbb"/&gt;

<h2>Security Questions</h2>
<div style="margin-left: 2em;">
<p><a name="s301" id="s301"></a><b>How secure is Java Web
Start?</b></p>
<p>Security is a key consideration of the Java Web Start
design.&nbsp; In Java Web Start all applications are launched by
default in a secure &quot;sandbox.&quot;<br />
<a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
<p><a name="s302" id="s302"></a><b>What is a secure
sandbox?</b></p>
<p>Applications in the secure sandbox have restricted access to
local computing resources such as the disk and network.<br />
<a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
<p><a name="s303" id="s303"></a><b>How is the Java Web Start secure
sandbox more flexible than the applet sandbox?</b></p>
<p>All applications, by default, are run in a sandboxed
environment, similar to the applet sandbox. However, Java Web Start
provides a secure API that enables an application to import and
export files from the local disk under the user's control. The API
includes dialog boxes for operations such as saving a file and
opening a file that are actually rendered by Java Web Start, and
not by the application itself.</p>
<p>This sandbox design is similar to what you can do with HTML. A
file input field in an HTML form enables a user to pick a file from
the local disk and submit the name (excluding path) and
content&nbsp; to the web server. Similarly, most browsers support
the 'Save as...' option.<br />
<a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
<p><a name="s304" id="s304"></a><b>How can I enable my application
to gain unrestricted access to the system?</b></p>
<p>An application requesting unrestricted system access must be
digitally signed. The first time a user launches such an
application, a security dialog box will appear. Before running the
application, Java Web Start will prompt the user to accept the
digital certificate. After the user has accepted the certificate,
subsequent invocations will not show the security dialog box.<br />
<a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
<p><a name="s305" id="s305"></a><b>Is there support for encrypted
download of JAR files?</b></p>
<p>Support for encrypting data transferred from the server to the
client is very important. This is an important point on our issue
list, and we will definitely make sure that HTTPS libraries will
work with applications that are launched with Java Web Start. The
HTTPS support might be in an optional package that you need to
specify that your application depends on.</p>
<p>Encrypting the JAR files transferred from the server to the
client may not be necessary. The reason is, even if the class files
where encrypted on the wire, they will have to be decrypted on the
client side and stored to disk, so the JVM will be able to load the
classes. Thus, it could be fairly simple for a cracker to get
around the encryption of the JAR files.</p>
<p>Instead, what is important for JAR files is that they can be
signed, so the user can be absolutely sure that the application is
from the vendor he expect it to be from. This is already
supported.<br />
<a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
<p><a name="s306" id="s306"></a><b>Can I use NTLM authentication
with Java Web Start?</b></p>
<p>NTLM support was added to Java 1.4.2 on Windows platforms only.
You can use NTLM authentication with Java Web Start in 1.4.2 and
beyond. The JAuthenticator dialog may contain some misleading text
when using NTLM with Java Web Start 1.4.2, but this is fixed in
Java Web Start 1.5.0.<br />
<a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
<p><a name="s307" id="s307"></a><b>Can I use HTTPS protocol with
Java Web Start?</b></p>
<p>HTTPS support was added to
Java in version 1.4. You can use use HTTPS protocol for Java Web
Start resources starting in version 1.2, but may encounter one of
several problems that were addressed in Java Web Start 1.4.2. It is
recommended to use at least Java Web Start 1.4.2 if using HTTPS
protocol.<br />
