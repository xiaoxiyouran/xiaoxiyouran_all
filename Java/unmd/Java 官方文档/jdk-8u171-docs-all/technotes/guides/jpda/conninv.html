<h3><a name="Transports" id="Transports"></a>Transports</h3>
A JPDA <i>Transport</i> is a method of communication between a
debugger and the virtual machine that is being debugged (hereafter
the <i>target VM</i>). The communication is connection oriented -
one side acts as a server, listening for a connection. The other
side acts as a client and connects to the server. JPDA allows
either the debugger application or the target VM to act as the
server. Transport implementations can allow communications between
processes running on a single machine, on different machines, or
either. When establishing a connection a <i>transport addresses</i>
is used to identify the end-point of the connection. The format of
a transport address depends on the type of transport.
<p>Within JPDA the debugger application uses the Java Debug
Interface (JDI) interface and the <a href=
"#Connectors">Connector</a> abstraction to establish a connection
to the target VM. The Connector used by the debugger application
encapsulates the transport. On the target VM an agent supporting
the Java Debug Wire Protocol is
used to communicate with the debugger. This agent (which may be
built into the target VM or loaded from a runtime library)
encapsulates the transport to communicate with the debugger.</p>
<p>Two transport implementations are shipped with the reference
implementation: A socket transport based on TCP/IP, and a shared
memory transport. The specifications do not require any specific
transport implementation to exist. In addition to transports
provided with the implementation the architecture includes <a href=
"#SPI">service provider interfaces</a> to allow additional
transports be developed and deployed.</p>
<h4>Socket Transport</h4>
The JPDA reference implementation provides a socket transport for
the Solaris, Linux, and Microsoft Windows platforms. With the
socket transport, the debugger application and the target VM can
reside either on the same machine or on different machines. The
socket transport uses a single stream TCP/IP connection between the
debugger application and the target VM. Both IPv4 and IPv6 are
supported on the JDI side of the socket transport. The current
implementation on the target VM side only supports IPv4, but this
could change in a future release so that both IPv4 and IPv6 are
supported.
<p>Command and reply packets are written to the stream in
accordance with the <a href="./jdwp-spec.html">JDWP
specification</a> using the <a href="./jdwpTransport.html">JDWP
Transport Interface</a>. Since many small packets can be sent over
JDWP, the TCP_NO_DELAY socket option can improve performance in
some socket implementations by avoiding delays that could occur if
the socket implementation buffers small packets before sending
them. Sockets are closed gracefully so that unsent data is sent if
possible.</p>
<p>The socket transport is identified through a unique string,
<tt>dt_socket</tt>. This name can be used to select the socket
transport when <a href="#Invocation">invoking</a> the target VM.
Within the debugger application a corresponding Connector is used
which encapsulates the socket transport.</p>
<p>In contexts where a client is attaching to a server, socket
transport addresses have the format
"<tt>&lt;name&gt;:&lt;port&gt;</tt>" where <tt>&lt;name&gt;</tt> is
the host name and <tt>&lt;port&gt;</tt> is the socket port number
at which it attaches or listens. In contexts where a server is
waiting for a client to attach, the address consists of the port
number alone (the host name is implicit).</p>
<h4>Shared Memory Transport</h4>
In addition to the socket transport, the JPDA reference
implementation provides a shared memory transport on the Microsoft
Windows platform. The shared memory transport uses a shared memory
region to exchange JDWP packets between the debugger application
and the target VM. With the shared memory transport, the debugger
application and target VM must reside on the same machine.
<p>The shared memory transport is identified through a unique
string, <tt>dt_shmem</tt>. This name can be used to select the
socket transport when <a href="#Invocation">invoking</a> the target
VM. Within the debugger application a corresponding Connector is
used which encapsulates the shared memory transport.</p>
<p>Shared memory transport addresses are simply names that can be
used as Microsoft Windows file-mapping object names. The name
string can consist of any combination of characters, excluding the
backslash.</p>
<h3><a name="Connectors" id="Connectors"></a>Connectors</h3>
A <i>connector</i> is a JDI abstraction that is used in
establishing a connection between a debugger application (written
to the JDI) and a target VM. Different JDI implementations are free
to provide different connector implementations to match the
transports and VMs they support. The connector interfaces are very
general, to allow JDI to be used with varying connector
implementations. Connectors are configured through a set of
name/value pairs. Specific connectors accept different name/value
pairs.
<p>A good JDI client application will allow users to choose and
configure any connector that may be present, but it can be
beneficial to incorporate knowledge of specific connectors into the
debugger to make their configuration a more pleasant user
experience. The example <a href="#JDB">JDB</a> implementation
provided with the JPDA illustrates this approach.</p>
<p>The JDI reference implementations provides several connectors
which map to the available transport types and the modes of
connection (launching, listening, and attaching). These connectors
are described in the following sections. A List containing these
connectors is returned by JDI method
VirtualMachineManager.allConnectors(). In addition, each attaching,
listening, and launching connector is contained in the lists
returned by the corresponding VirtualMachineManager methods
attachingConnectors(), listeningConnectors(), and
launchingConnectors().</p>
<h4><a name="sunlaunch" id="sunlaunch"></a>Command Line
Launching Connector</h4>
This connector can be used by a debugger application to launch an
Oracle VM or any other VM which supports the same invocation <a href=
"#Invocation">options</a> with respect to debugging. The details of
launching the VM and specifying the necessary debug options are
handled by the connector. The underlying transport used by this
connector depends on the platform. On Microsoft Windows, the shared
memory transport is used. On Solaris and Linux the socket transport
is used.
<p>This connector is uniquely identified by the name
"com.sun.jdi.CommandLineLaunch".<br />

<h4>SA Core Attaching Connector</h4>
This connector can be used by a debugger application to debug a
core file. &nbsp;It is possible that the core file is corrupted to
the extent that not all available debugging operations can be
performed on it.<br />
<br />
The VirtualMachine object returned by this connector's attach()
method is 'read-only'. &nbsp;This means that the method:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
vm.canBeModified()<br />
will return false, and that the JDI client should not call any JDI
methods that are defined to throw a VMCannotBeModifiedException in
this case. The word size (i.e. 32 bit/64 bit) and version
(e.g. 5.0, 5.1) of the debugger's Virtual Machine must be the same
as that of the Virtual Machine of the process from which the core
file was produced.<br />
This connector allows multiple debugging sessions on the same core
file.<br />

<h4>SA Debug Server Attaching Connector</h4>
This connector can be used by a debugger application to debug a
process or core file on a machine other than the machine upon which
the debugger is running.&nbsp; It is not available on the Linux
Itanium platform. It is possible that the remote process/core file
is corrupted to the extent that not all available debugging
operations can be performed on it.<br />

will return false, and that the JDI client should not call any JDI
methods that are defined to throw a VMCannotBeModifiedException in
this case.<br />
<br />
This connector uses RMI to communicate with a 'debug server'
running on the remote machine.<br />
Before&nbsp; the attach() method on this connector is called,&nbsp;
the debug server must be started on the remote machine<br />
and told what process or corefile is to be debugged. &nbsp;The
following must be done on the remote machine:&nbsp;<br />
<ul>
<li>start the RMI registry with sa-jdi.jar in the classpath:</li>
</ul>
<pre class="codeblock">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
${JAVA_HOME}/bin/rmiregistry -J-Xbootclasspath/p:${JAVA_HOME}/lib/sa-jdi.jar
</pre>
<ul>
<li>start the 'debug-server' on the remote machine, specifying the
process or corefile to be debugged:</li>
</ul>
<pre class="codeblock">
${JAVA_HOME}/bin/java \ 
    -classpath ${JAVA_HOME}/lib/sa-jdi.jar \
    sun.jvm.hotspot.jdi.SADebugServer \
    &lt;pid&gt; \
    [uniqueID]
</pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre>
${JAVA_HOME}/bin/java \
    -classpath ${JAVA_HOME}/lib/sa-jdi.jar \
    sun.jvm.hotspot.jdi.SADebugServer \
    &lt;pathname to the java executable that produced the core file&gt;\
    &lt;pathname of the corefile to debug&gt; \
    &nbsp;[uniqueID]
</pre>
<br />
<p>An alternative to the above two steps is to use the <tt>jsadebugd</tt>
(<a href="../../tools/unix/jsadebugd.html">Solaris, Linux, or Mac OS X</a>
or <a href="../../tools/windows/jsadebugd.html">Windows</a>) command to start
the RMI registry and debug-server on the remote machine.</p>
<p>'uniqueID' is an optional string. &nbsp;If more than one debug
server is to run at the same time on the same machine, then each
must have&nbsp; a different 'uniqueID' string.</p>
<p>In the above, JAVA_HOME must contain the pathname of a Java
installation that is the same bit size (i.e. 32 bit/64 bit) and the
same version (e.g. 5.0, 5.1) as the version used by the debuggee.
&nbsp;However the debugger does not have to be the same bit size
and version.</p>
<p>A process to be debugged need not have been started in debug
mode(ie, with -agentlib:jdwp or -Xrunjdwp). &nbsp;It is permissable
for the process to be hung. The process is suspended when the debug
server attaches to it. When a debug server attached to a process is
killed (by ^C or other means), the debuggee process will be
resumed. Attaching more than one debug server to a corefile is
permitted, but only one debug server can be attached to a
process.</p>
<p>This connector allows multiple debugging sessions connected to
the same debug server.</p>

<h3><a name="Invocation" id="Invocation"></a>Oracle VM Invocation Options</h3>
This section describes the options necessary to invoke an Oracle VM for

<dd>Loads the JPDA reference implementation of JDWP. This library
resides in the target VM and uses JVM TI and JNI to interact with
it. It uses a transport and the JDWP protocol to communicate with a

<h3><a name="Plugin" id="Plugin"></a>Debugging Plug-in Applets</h3>
Applets running under Java Plug-in can be debugged. The required VM options
described <a href="#Invocation">above</a> can be specified in the
Plug-In control panel, under the "Basic" tab, in the "Java Run-Time
Parameters". The debug options under the "Advanced" tab should not
be used as they will enable the old <tt>sun.tools.debug</tt> debug
support. In future versions of Java Plug-in, these debug options
will be changed to use JPDA.
<p>JDI launching <a href="#Connectors">connectors</a> cannot be
used to debug Plug-in applets.</p>
<h3><a name="JDB" id="JDB"></a>Connecting with JDB</h3>
The example implementation of JDB provided with the JPDA, provides
an illustration of the usage of JDI connectors. There are
"shortcut" options to JDB which assume the use of connectors known
to it (that is, connectors present in the reference
implementation). It also provides a way to establish a general
connection using any connector. While JDB is hardly an example of a
good debugger interface, it does provide a simple example of
connectors in use.
<p>In JDB, the -attach option provides access to one of the
attaching connectors in the reference implementation (shared memory
on Microsoft Windows, sockets on the Solaris and Linux platforms).
The -listen option provides access to one of the listening
connectors in the reference implementation (shared memory on
Microsoft Windows, sockets on the Solaris and Linux platforms). A
class name and arguments specified directly on the command line
provide access to the command line launching connector.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p><tt>jdb -attach myhost:8000</tt></p>
<p>is an easy way to attach to a target VM with the Socket
Attaching Connector (on the Solaris operating environment), and</p>
<p><tt>jdb Hello 1 2 3</tt></p>
<p>is an easy way to launch a target VM with the Command Line
Launching Connector.</p>
<p>However, the -connect option is also provided by JDB to handle
any connector by taking an&nbsp; connector name and a set of
arbitrary name/value argument pairs. For example the command lines
above have the following equivalents.</p>
<p><tt>jdb -connect
com.sun.jdi.SocketAttach:hostname=myhost,port=8000</tt><br />
<tt>jdb -connect "com.sun.jdi.CommandLineLaunch:main=Hello 1 2
3"</tt></p>
<p>These command lines are more cumbersome than the ones above, but
the -connect option can be used with any connector. This kind of
operation is a primitive example of how a JDI debugger can deal
with any kind of connector while providing a simplified interface
for dealing with common, well-known connectors.</p>

<h3><a name="SPI" id="SPI"></a>Service Provider Interfaces</h3>
<p>JPDA includes service provider interfaces to allow the
development and deployment of connector and transport
implementations. These service provider interfaces allow debugger
and other tool vendors develop new connector implementations and
provide addition transport mechanisms over and beyond the socket
and shared memory transport provided by Oracle. The service provider
interfaces in JDI are specified in the <a href=
"../../../jdk/api/jpda/jdi/com/sun/jdi/connect/spi/package-summary.html">
com.sun.jdi.connect.spi</a> package.</p>
<p>In addition to the service provider interfaces in JDI the Oracle
implementation also includes a transport library interface called
the <a href="jdwpTransport.html">Java Debug Wire Protocol Transport Interface</a>. A
transport library is loaded by the JDWP agent in the target VM and
is used to establish a connection to the debugger and to transport
JDWP packets between the debugger and the VM.</p>
<p>Further information on the service provider interfaces can be in
the document <a href="jpda_spis.html">Java Platform Debugger Architecture - Service Provider Interfaces</a>.</p>
