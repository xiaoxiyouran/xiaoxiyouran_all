Scenarios</h2>
<p class="body"><a name="pgfId_998354" id="pgfId_998354"></a>This
section outlines a few application scenarios to help illustrate the
capabilities enabled by JNDI.</p>
<div style="margin-left: 2em">
<p>The examples below are not meant to be prescriptive. There are
often several ways to solve a problem, and JNDI is designed with
flexibility in mind.</p>
<h3 class="section"><a name="pgfId_998356" id=
"pgfId_998356"></a>7.1 User authentication</h3>
<p class="body"><a name="pgfId_998357" id="pgfId_998357"></a>In
secure systems, a user must authenticate himself to the computer,
network, or service that he wishes to access. For example, logging
into UNIX requires the user to supply a password. Similarly, use of
SSL requires that the user supply his X.509 certificate. Such
authentication information can be stored as attributes associated
with each user in the directory. The system performing the
authentication would look up the attribute (for example,
&quot;password&quot;) of the user and verify the authenticity using
the information supplied by the user.</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
 
DirContext ctx = new InitialDirContext();       
Attribute attr = ctx.getAttributes(userName).get(&quot;password&quot;);
String password = (String)attr.get();
</pre>
<h3 class="section"><a name="pgfId_998362" id=
"pgfId_998362"></a>7.2 Electronic Mail</h3>
<p class="body"><a name="pgfId_998363" id="pgfId_998363"></a>A
useful feature of an electronic mail system is a directory service
that provides a mapping between users and email addresses. This
allows mail users to search for the email address of a particular
user. This is analogous to searching for an individual's telephone
number in the phone book in order to dial his phone number. For
example, when I want to send mail to John Smith in my department, I
search for &quot;John Smith&quot; in the directory using a
&quot;search&quot; widget in the mail application. The widget
returns to me five entries of John Smith, from which I select the
one that is in a building on my site and use the email address
attribute associated with that entry.</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
NamingEnumeration matches = deptCtx.search(&quot;user&quot;, new BasicAttributes(&quot;name&quot;, &quot;John Smith&quot;)); 
// use matches to construct a selectable list for end-user
while (matches.hasMore()) {
    SearchResult item = (SearchResult) matches.next();
    Attributes info = item.getAttributes();     
    /* display attributes */
    ...
}
</pre>
<p class="body"><a name="pgfId_998375" id="pgfId_998375"></a>The
directory could also be used by users to set up personalized
address books. For example, once I have located John Smith's email
address, I might not want to search the directory again each time I
send him mail. Instead, I can create a personal subtree in the
directory in which I maintain entries that I frequently use,
possibly by creating links to the existing entries.</p>
<div>
<h3 class="section"><a name="pgfId_998376" id=
"pgfId_998376"></a>7.3 Databases</h3>
<p class="body"><a name="pgfId_998377" id=
"pgfId_998377"></a>Database applications can use the directory to
locate database servers. For example, a financial application needs
to get the stock quotes from a stock quote server using JDBC. This
application can enable the user to select the stock quote server
based on specification of some attributes (such as coverage of
which markets and frequency of quote updates). The application
searches the directory for quote servers that meet these
attributes, and then retrieves the &quot;location&quot; attribute
(a JDBC URL) of the selected quote server and connects to it.</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
NamingEnumeration matches =     ctx.search(&quot;service/stockQuotes&quot;,
                                        &quot;(&amp;(market=NASDAQ)(updateFreqency&lt;=300))&quot;, searchctls);        
while (matches.hasMore()) {     
           SearchResult item = (SearchResult)matches.next();    
           Attribute location = item.getAttributes().get(&quot;location&quot;);         
   ...
}
</pre></div>
<div>
<h3 class="section"><a name="pgfId_998386" id=
"pgfId_998386"></a>7.4 Browsing</h3>
<p class="body"><a name="pgfId_998387" id="pgfId_998387"></a>When
using almost any kind of interactive application that asks a user
to input names, the user's job is made easier if a namespace
browser is available to him. The browser can either be built into
the application and tailored to suit that application in
particular, or it can be more general-purpose such as a typical web
browser.</p>
<p class="body"><a name="pgfId_998388" id="pgfId_998388"></a>A very
simple example of a JNDI browser allows a user to &quot;walk&quot;
through a namespace, viewing the atomic names at each step along
the way. The browser prints a &quot;*&quot; to highlight the name
of each <code>Context</code> , thus telling the user where he can
go next. <a href="#pgfId_998391" class="footnote">1</a></p>
<pre class="codeblock">
// Start at the top -- the initial context.
Context ctx = new InitialContext();
while (ctx != null) {           // display one level
    NamingEnumeration   items = ctx.list();
    while (items.hasMoreElements()) {
        NameClassPair item = (NameClassPair)items.next();
        if (isContext(item.getClassName())) {
            System.out.print(&quot;*&quot;);
        } else {
            System.out.print(&quot; &quot;);
        }
        System.out.println(&quot; &quot; + item.getName());
    }
    // Take the next step down into the namespace.
    String target = input.readLine();
    try {
        ctx = (Context)ctx.lookup(target);
    } catch (NamingException e) {
        // handle error
    } catch (ClassCastException e) {
        // not a context; cannot traverse
    }
}
</pre></div>

<h3 class="section"><a name="pgfId_998418" id=
"pgfId_998418"></a>7.5 Network Printing</h3>
<p class="body"><a name="pgfId_998419" id="pgfId_998419"></a>An
important function of a printing service is to provide a means for
its human users to easily discover and select printers in the
network. An application that needs to print, or the machine on
which it runs, should not have to be configured each time a new
printer is added to the network. The scope of network access to
printers may range from a workgroup to global. The printing service
can use the directory to provide this capability.</p>
<p class="body"><a name="pgfId_998420" id="pgfId_998420"></a>Assume
that printers are represented by a <code>Printer</code> interface.
One of the methods in it could be <code>print()</code> which, when
given an <code>InputStream</code> , will read data from
<code>InputStream</code> and print it on the printer represented by
this instance of Printer.</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
interface Printer {    
        void print(InputStream data) throws PrinterException;   
        ...
}
</pre>
<p class="body"><a name="pgfId_998425" id="pgfId_998425"></a>A user
selects a printer using a logical printer name, either explicitly
or through default settings. For example, the user might have
specified a default printer to use for all his applications, which
is overridden only when he explicitly specifies another printer to
use. The application that is accepting the print request takes the
printer name and looks it up in the directory service. The
application expects to receive as the result an object that
implements the <code>Printer</code> interface.</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
void myAppPrint(String printerName, String fileName) throws IOException {
    try {
        DirContext ctx = new InitialDirContext();
        Printer prt = (Printer) ctx.lookup(printerName);
        prt.print(new FileInputStream(fileName));
    } catch (NamingException e){
        System.err.println(&quot;Could not locate printer: &quot; + e);
    } catch (ClassCastException e) {
        System.err.println(printerName + &quot;does not name a printer&quot;);
    }
}
</pre>
<h4 class="subsection"><a name="pgfId_998438" id=
"pgfId_998438"></a>7.5.1 Browsing and searching for printers</h4>
<p class="body"><a name="pgfId_998439" id=
"pgfId_998439"></a>Selecting a printer by explicitly giving its
name is but one way of identifying a printer. The user can also use
the directory to see the different printers available (browsing),
or to search for printers with particular attributes. For example
the user can ask the directory to list all the printers on the
second floor of building 5 in the Mountain View campus, or search
for all color laser printers with 600dpi resolution. From the
application's perspective, just as <code>lookup()</code> returned a
<code>Printer</code> object, the list and search operations also
provide the same capability of returning <code>Printer</code>
objects that the application could use to submit print
requests.</p>
