<h1>Java Naming and Directory Interface</h1>

<p><a name="a130875" id="a130875"></a></p>
<i>The Java Naming and Directory Interface technology
(<strong>JNDI</strong>) provides a unified interface to multiple
naming and directory services. As part of the Java enterprise API
set, <strong>JNDI</strong> enables seamless connectivity to
heterogeneous enterprise naming and directory services. Developers
can now build powerful and portable directory-enabled Java
applications using this industry-standard interface.</i>
<p><i><a name="a130592" id="a130592"></a> The <strong>JNDI</strong>
specification was developed by Sun Microsystems with a number of
leading industry partners, including Novell, Netscape, SCO, and
BEA.</i></p>

<h2><i>Technical Overview</i></h2>
<p><i><a name="a129732" id="a129732"></a> Directory services play a
vital role in Intranets and Internets by providing access to a
variety of information about users, machines, networks, services,
and applications. By its very nature, a directory service
incorporates a naming facility for providi ng human understandable
namespaces that characterize the arrangement and identification of
the various entities.</i></p>
<p><i><a name="a129713" id="a129713"></a> The computing environment
of an enterprise typically consists of several naming facilities
often representing different parts of a <em>composite</em>
namespace. For example, the Internet Domain Name System (DNS) may
be used as the top-level naming facilit y for different
organizations within an enterprise. The organizations themselves
may use a directory service such as LDAP or NDS or NIS. From a
user's perspective, there is one namespace consisting of composite
names. URLs are examples of composite names because they span
namespaces of multiple naming facilities. Applications which use
directory services must support this user perspective.</i></p>
<p><i><a name="a129714" id="a129714"></a> Many Java application
developers can benefit from a directory service API that is not
only independent of the particular directory or naming service
implementation, but also enables seamless access to directory
objects through multiple naming facilities. In fact, an application
can attach its own objects to the namespace. Such a facility
enables any Java application to discover and retrieve objects of
any type.</i></p>
<p><i><a name="a129715" id="a129715"></a> <strong>JNDI</strong>
provides directory and naming functionality to Java applications.
It is defined to be independent of any specific directory service
implementation. Thus, a variety of directories, new and existing
ones in the installed base, can be a ccessed in a common
way.</i></p>
<p><i><a name="a129717" id="a129717"></a> <strong>JNDI</strong>
also defines a service provider's interface which allows various
directory and naming service drivers to be plugged in.</i></p>
<i><a name="a129718" id="a129718"></a></i>
<h2><i>Examples</i></h2>
<p><i><a name="a130556" id="a130556"></a> Here are two examples to
briefly illustrate some of the more commonly used features of
<strong>JNDI</strong>.</i></p>
<p><i><a name="a129719" id="a129719"></a> An application that wants
to access a printer needs the corresponding printer object. This is
simply done as follows:</i></p>
<pre>
<i>prt = (Printer)
        building7.lookup("puffin");
prt.print(document);
</i>
</pre>
<p><i><a name="a129722" id="a129722"></a> where
<code>building7</code> is the naming context representing a
physical building that provides a convenient context for referring
to the printers.</i></p>
<p><i><a name="a129723" id="a129723"></a> <strong>JNDI</strong>
does all the work of locating the information needed to construct
the printer object.</i></p>
<p><i><a name="a129724" id="a129724"></a> As another example, an
application that wants to find a person's phone numbers, which are
stored in the organization's directory, can simply do:</i></p>
<pre>
<i>String[] attrs = {"workPhone", "cellPhone", "faxNumber"};
bobsPhones = directory.getAttributes("cn=Bob,o=Widget,c=US", attrs);
</i>
</pre>
<p><i><a name="a130584" id="a130584"></a> If there may be several
Bobs in the Widget organization, the application can search the
organization's directory to find the right Bob as follows:</i></p>
<pre>
<i>bob = directory.search("o=Widget,c=US","(cn=Bob)", controls);
</i>
</pre>
<p><i><a name="a130487" id="a130487"></a> Other application
examples include access to security credentials stored in an
enterprise-wide directory service, access to electronic mail
addresses, and access to addresses of a variety of existing
services such as databases, network file systems, etc.</i></p>

<h2><i>Overview of Interfaces</i></h2>
<i><a name="a130117" id="a130117"></a></i>
<h3><i>The Naming Interface - javax.naming</i></h3>
<p><i><a name="a130159" id="a130159"></a> <code>Context</code> is
the core interface that specifies a naming context. It defines
basic operations such as adding a name-to-object binding, looking
up the object bound to a specified name, listing the bindings,
removing a name-to-object binding, crea ting and destroying
subcontexts of the same type, <em>etc.</em></i></p>
<p><i><a name="a130160" id="a130160"></a>
<code>Context.lookup()</code> is the most commonly used operation.
The context implementation can return an object of whatever class
is required by the Java application. For example, an application
might use the name of a printer to look up the correspond ing
<code>Printer</code> object, and then print to it directly:</i></p>
<pre>
<i>Printer printer = (Printer)
 ctx.lookup("treekiller");
printer.print(report);
</i>
</pre>
<p><i><a name="a130576" id="a130576"></a> The application is not
exposed to any naming service implementation. In fact, a new type
of naming service can be introduced without requiring the
application to be modified or even disrupted if it is
running.</i></p>
<i><a name="a130165" id="a130165"></a></i>
<h3><i>The Directory Interface - javax.naming.directory</i></h3>
<p><i><a name="a130193" id="a130193"></a> <em>Directory Objects and
Attributes.</em> The <code>DirContext</code> interface enables the
directory capability by defining methods for examining and updating
attributes associated with a directory object. Each directory
object contains a set of zero or more objects of class
<code>Attribute</code>. Each attribute is denoted by a string
identifier and can have zero or more values of any type.</i></p>
<p><i><a name="a130195" id="a130195"></a> <em>Directory Objects as
Naming Context.</em> The <code>DirContext</code> interface also
behaves as a naming context by extending the <code>Context</code>
interface. This means that any directory object can also provide a
naming context. In addition to a directory object keeping a variety
of information about a person, for example, it is also a natural
naming context for resources associated with that person: a
person's printers, file system, calendar, <em>etc.</em></i></p>
<p><i><a name="a130198" id="a130198"></a> <em>Searches.</em> The
<code>DirContext</code> interface supports content-based searching
of directories. In the simplest and most common form of usage, the
application specifies a set of attributes - possibly with specific
values - to match. It then invo kes the
<code>DirContext.search()</code> method on the directory object,
which returns the matching directory objects along with the
requested attributes.</i></p>
<i><a name="a130792" id="a130792"></a></i>
<h3><i>The Event Interface - javax.naming.event</i></h3>
<p><i><a name="a130808" id="a130808"></a> <em>Naming Events</em>.
The <code>NamingEvent</code> class represents an event generated by
a naming or directory service. Examples of a
<code>NamingEvent</code> are a change to a directory entry's
attribute or a rename of a directory entry.</i></p>
<p><i><a name="a130898" id="a130898"></a> <em>Naming
Listeners</em>. A <code>NamingListener</code> is an object that
registers interests in <code>NamingEvent</code>s. Listeners
register with a context to receive notification of changes in the
context, its children, or its subtree.</i></p>
<i><a name="a130796" id="a130796"></a></i>
<h3><i>The LDAP Interface - javax.naming.ldap</i></h3>
<p><i><a name="a130837" id="a130837"></a> The
<code>LdapContext</code> interface allows an application to use
LDAP v3-specific features, including <em>extensions</em> and
<em>controls</em>, not already covered by the more generic
<code>DirContext</code> interface.</i></p>
<i><a name="a130245" id="a130245"></a></i>
<h3><i>The Service Provider Interface - javax.naming.spi</i></h3>
<p><i><a name="a130253" id="a130253"></a> The <strong>JNDI</strong>
SPI provides the means by which different naming/directory service
providers can develop and hook up their implementations so that the
corresponding services are accessible from applications that use
<strong>JNDI</strong>. In add ition, because <strong>JNDI</strong>
allows specification of names that span multiple namespaces, if one
service provider implementation needs to interact with another in
order to complete an operation, the SPI provides methods that allow
different provider implementations to cooperate to complete client
<strong>JNDI</strong> operations.</i></p>
