<p><b>CHAPTER 2</b> <a name="a5529" id="a5529"><!-- --></a></p>
<h1>Goals</h1>
<h2><a name="a996730" id="a996730"><i>2.1</i> API Goals</a></h2>
<p>The design of the Image I/O API was influenced by the desire to support 
a number of primary goals. Each goal provides the justification for a 
particular set of API features. These goals may be divided into those 
motivated mainly by the needs of client-side applications, and those
motivated by the needs of server applications. Naturally, these
primary goals represent only a fraction of the capabilities of the
API. They are listed here in order to provide a sense of the
motivations that went into the design of the API.</p>
<p><a name="a997049" id="a997049"><!-- --></a> As a general rule of
thumb, whenever a tradeoff between ease of use for application
developers and plug-in developers was identified, the application
developer was given a higher priority. Since relatively few users
of the API are expected to write plug-ins, and even those
developers who do write plug-ins will typically write no more than
a handful in order to support formats of immediate use to them, it
makes sense to push complexity into the plug-ins rather than into
applications.</p>
<p><a name="a997059" id="a997059"><!-- --></a> To ameliorate the
complexity of plug-in development, some utility methods and
implementation classes are provided that perform common functions.
However, it is not possible to provide implementation classes to
cover every situation, and providing an excessive number of utility
classes and methods would increase the footprint for all API users
even if they did not use non-standard plug-ins. We expect that
plug-in developers will be able to incorporate source code from
existing plug-ins and sample code into their plug-ins. While this
might lead to some redundancy when using multiple, independently
developed plug-ins, most users will probably use only a small
number of plug-ins at a time in any case. Thus, we believe the cost
of having to load code that might theoretically be shared but
actually is not will tend to outweight the cost of loading some
redundant code when many plug-ins are used.</p>
<p><a name="a997065" id="a997065"><!-- --></a></p>
<br />
<h3><a name="a997066" id="a997066"><!-- --></a> <i>2.1.1</i>
Client-Side Application Goals</h3>
<a name="a996980" id="a996980"><!-- --></a>
<p><i><b>Pluggability</b></i> <a name="a996975" id="a996975">
<!-- --></a> An application written to use the Image I/O API should
be able to automatically take advantage of new plug-ins without any
rewriting or recompilation. This requires that plug-ins follow, as
much as possible, a set of format-neutral interfaces. However,
every image format has unique properties and capabilities, which
plug-ins must be able to expose to applications. This is
accomplished by allowing plug-ins to extend a number of interfaces
within the API. Applications that are unaware of the plug-in
specific extensions may continue to make use of the normal plug-in
capabilities, while aware applications may use the extended
interfaces.</p>
<p><a name="a996991" id="a996991"><!-- --></a> Both generic and
plug-in specific access to metadata (non-image data) is supported
by allowing plug-ins to provide access to metadata in multiple
formats. These may include plug-in specific formats, a plug-in
neutral format defined by the API, and industry standard formats.</p>
<p><a name="a996893" id="a996893"><!-- --></a> <i><b>Automatic and
Manual Plug-in Installation and Selection</b></i> <a name="a996930"
id="a996930"><!-- --></a> 
For simple applications that wish to load images without user intervention, 
it is important to allow a reader plug-in to be selected automatically 
based on file contents. However, it is desirable to avoid the loading and 
instantiation of complex classes unless they are needed. A plug-in must be 
able to determine whether it can handle a particular image without loading
all of its code. In order to meet this goal, plug-ins are instantiated via 
a service provider interface mechanism that allows simple queries to be 
performed without loading the main body of plug-in code.</p>
<p><a name="a996946" id="a996946"><!-- --></a> All of the bytecode
(.class) files associated with a plug-in may be combined into a JAR
file, which may be installed permanently into a Java Runtime
Environment, or loaded dynamically using the application
<code>CLASSPATH</code> mechanism.</p>
<p><a name="a996939" id="a996939"><!-- --></a> <i><b>Manual Plug-in
Selection</b></i> <a name="a996947" id="a996947"><!-- --></a>
Although automatic plug-in selection is convenient for many
applications, it must be possible for more sophisticated
applications to exercise greater control over the plug-in selection
process. This is accomplished by means of a run-time registry of
plug-ins that may be queried and manipulated by an application.</p>
<p><a name="a996928" id="a996928"><!-- --></a> <i><b>Network,
Disk-based, and Direct I/O</b></i> <a name="a996948" id="a996948">
<!-- --></a> Increasingly, applications must deal with both
disk-based and network-based data. In many cases, even disk-based
data must be dealt with in the form of an <code>InputStream</code>
due to the needs of other APIs. The Image I/O API offers a set of
interfaces that allow data from <code>File</code>s,
<code>InputStream</code>s, or other sources to be handled in a
unified manner while preserving the ability to seek backwards and
forwards. The API is future-proofed to allow new I/O interfaces,
including direct interfaces to image acquisition and output
devices, to be used without rewriting application code.</p>
<p><a name=
"a996954" id="a996954"><!-- --></a> <i><b>Access to
Metadata</b></i> <a name="a996955" id="a996955"><!-- --></a> The
metadata stored alongside an image may be as important as the image
data. The Java Image I/O API provides thorough yet flexible access
to metadata. Since metadata may take many forms, and contain very
specialized information, it is difficult to provide direct access
to such metadata in a general-purpose API. Instead, the API
requires plug-ins to cast their metadata into the form of an XML
Document structure, possibly enhanced with <code>Object</code>
references in addition to textual data. Once this has been done,
the metadata may be accessed and edited using standard XML DOM
(Document Object Model) interfaces. The syntax of the
<code>Document</code>s will vary from plug-in to plug-in, but the
structure may be traversed, displayed, and edited without specific
knowledge of the plug-in being used.</p>
<p><a name="a997004" id="a997004"><!-- --></a> <i><b>Support for Advanced
Applications</b></i> <a name="a997010" id="a997010"><!-- --></a> In
order to support advanced applications, the API must provide access
to features such as &#34;thumbnail&#34; images, multiple images
stored in a file, muli-resolution imagery, and tiled imagery. It
must provide the capability to decode portions of a larger image,
and to perform subsampling during decoding in order to allow
panning over very large images. When writing images, it must be
possible to write image data piece-by-piece, without storing the
entire image in memory at once.</p>
<h3><a name="a997020" id="a997020"><!-- --></a> <i>2.1.2</i> Server
Use Cases</h3>
<p><a name="a996929" id="a996929"><!-- --></a> <i><b>Dynamic image
generation</b></i> <a name="a996897" id="a996897"><!-- --></a>
Modern web servers typically generate a large portion of their
content dynamically. The Java Servlet and Java Server Pages (JSP)
APIs provide portable ways to generate HTML pages in response to
requests from web browsers. Just as unique, custom HTML may be
generated for each user, it is possible to customize image content.</p>
<p><a name="a996901" id="a996901"><!-- --></a> In many cases, image
content must be generated dynamically. For example, consider
supplying stock price charts. While it might be possible to
generate and store a limited set of charts for each listed stock in
advance, if the user is allowed to add customizations such as the
time interval over which the price should be displayed, or a set of
indices or other stocks against which the stock price should be
compared, the number of possible images grows exponentially. Only a
dynamic approach can possibly allow such customization.</p>
<p><a name="a996949" id="a996949"><!-- --></a> <i><b>Image
Customization</b></i> <a name="a996950" id="a996950"><!-- --></a>
Web images are typically one-size-fits-all, with the same image
data being delivered regardless of the display capabilities of the
receiver. The increasing use of wireless and handheld devices will
require images that are customized for their limited bandwidth and
display capabilities. Desktop computers have seen increases in
their display resolution, causing many web images to appear too
small. The lack of scalable images also causes problems for
visually impaired users. Server-side image customization can be
used to provide optimal images for all users, with the image
resolution and color characteristics being chosen based on user
preferences.</p>
