<h2><a name="a998282" id="a998282"><i>3.7</i> Listening for
Events</a></h2>
<pre>
As an image is being read or written, the plug-in may provide updates to the 
application. The application may provide one or more classes that implement 
interfaces from the <code>javax.image.event</code> package. Instances of these classes are then 
added to the <code>ImageReader</code> or <code>ImageWriter</code> being used. For example,

class MyReadProgressListener implements IIOReadProgressListener {

        public MyReadProgressListener() {}

        public void imageStarted(ImageReader source) {
                System.out.println(&#34;Started reading!&#34;);
        }

        // Other methods from IIOReadProgressListener omitted
}

IIOReadProgressListener listener = new MyReadProgressListener();
reader.addIIOReadProgressListener(listener);
</pre>
<a name="a997179" id="a997179"><!-- --></a> As the
<code>ImageReader.read</code> method progresses, methods on
<code>listener</code> will be called at various times to indicate
how much of the image has been read. Because these methods are
being called while <code>ImageReader.read</code> is active, they
must not call most methods from the same <code>ImageReader</code>
object. They may call <code>ImageReader.abort()</code>, which will
cause <code>ImageReader.read</code> to return even if it is only
partially complete.<br />
<h3><a name="a997167" id="a997167"><!-- --></a> <i>3.7.1</i> The
<code>IIOReadProgressListener</code> Interface</h3>
<a name="a997182" id="a997182"><!-- --></a> An
<code>IIOReadProgressListener</code> may be used to provide simple
status information during reading. An estimate of the percentage of
completion of a read is provided, which may be used to update a
Swing <code>JProgressBar</code> or other progress indicator, or to
estimate the time remaining to read a large image.
<p><a name="a997258" id="a997258"><!-- --></a> The
<code>imageStarted</code> method will be called at the start of the
read. During the read, the <code>imageProgress</code> method will
be called multiple times, each time with a different, increasing
value for its <code>percentageDone</code> parameter. When the read
is about to complete, the <code>imageComplete</code> method will be
called.</p>
<p><a name="a997183" id="a997183"><!-- --></a> Similarly, the
<code>thumbnailStarted</code>, <code>thumbnailProgress</code>, and
<code>thumbnailComplete</code> methods will be called during
thumbnail reads.</p>
<p><a name="a997243" id="a997243"><!-- --></a> Other methods exist
to indicate the start and end of a sequence of image reads
performed by the <code>ImageReader.readAll</code> method.
Additionally, it is possible for an ongoing read to be aborted
using the <code>ImageReader.abort</code> method; in this case, the
listener&#39;s <code>readAborted</code> method will be called.</p>
<br />
<h3><a name="a997193" id="a997193"><!-- --></a> <i>3.7.2</i> The
<code>IIOReadUpdateListener</code> Interface</h3>
<a name="a997263" id="a997263"><!-- --></a> An
<code>IIOReadUpdateListener</code> provides more detailed
information on the progress of an image read. Some image formats
allow interlaced or progressive encoding, in which a subset of the
pixel data is made available quickly, so that a crude version of
the image may be displayed while the remainder of the pixel data is
still being received and decoded. A typical scheme might begin by
sending only every fourth row, and only every fourth pixel in each
of those rows, so that the initial image requires only one
sixteenth of the total amount of data to be transmitted and
decoded. If interlacing were not used, only the top one-sixteenth
of the image would be displayed in the same amount of time. Thus, a
person viewing an interlaced image will be able to get a sense of
its contents much sooner than if a traditional left-to-right,
top-to-bottom order were used.
<p><a name="a997317" id="a997317"><!-- --></a> By implementing the
methods of the <code>IIOReadUpdateListener</code> interface, an
application class can receive notification when groups of possibly
non-contiguous pixels are ready to be displayed. These methods also
receive a reference to the <code>BufferedImage</code> that is in
the process of being filled in, which may be used to refresh the
display to include the newly decoded pixels.</p>
<p><a name="a997288" id="a997288"><!-- --></a> When decoding an
interlaced or progressive image, the decoding proceeds in multiple
passes. At the start of each pass, the listener&#39;s
<code>passStarted</code> method will be called to indicate the set
of pixels that may be overwritten during the following pass. This
estimate is conservative; not every pixel in the region will
necessarily be updated during the pass. As the pass progresses, the
<code>imageUpdate</code> method will be called with arguments
describing the region of pixels that have receive new values. This
region is described by the coordinates of its upper-left corner,
its width and height, and the spacing between the pixels that make
up the pass (in the example above, both parameters would be equal
to 4 for the initial pass). When a pass has completed, the
<code>passComplete</code> method is called. Similar methods allow
the progress of thumbnail image reads to be tracked.</p>
<br />
<h3><a name="a997169" id="a997169"><!-- --></a> <i>3.7.3</i> The
<code>IIOReadWarningListener</code> Interface</h3>
<a name="a997170" id="a997170"><!-- --></a> By attaching an
<code>IIOReadWarningListener</code> to an <code>ImageReader</code>,
information on non-fatal errors may be received. For example, a
reader might detect a tag or chunk that should not be present. Even
though the reader may choose to ignore the error and proceed with
decoding, it may wish to inform the application that the input
source was malformed, as this could indicate problems in the
application that generated the images.
<p><a name="a997338" id="a997338"><!-- --></a>
<code>ImageReader</code>s may specify a set of <code>Locale</code>s
for which they can provide localized warning messages. The set of
available locales can be obtained from the reader&#39;s
<code>getAvailableLocales</code> method. The desired locale should
then be set by calling the reader&#39;s <code>setLocale</code>
method prior to attaching the <code>IIOReadWarningListener</code>.
Each listener will receive messages in the <code>Locale</code> that
was in effect at the time it was attached to the reader.</p>
<br />
<h3><a name="a997342" id="a997342"><!-- --></a> <i>3.7.4</i> The
<code>IIOWriteProgressListener</code> and
<code>IIOWriteWarningListener</code> Interfaces</h3>
<a name="a997343" id="a997343"><!-- --></a> The
<code>IIOWriteProgressListener</code> and
<code>IIOWriteWarningListener</code> interfaces function similarly
to their reader counterparts.<br />
