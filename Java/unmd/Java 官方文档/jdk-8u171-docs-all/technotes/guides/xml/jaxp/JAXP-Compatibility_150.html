<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The Java SE 1.4 platform included the "Crimson" reference
implementation for JAXP 1.1. The Java SE 5 platform includes a
reference implementation for JAXP 1.3 based on the Apache "Xerces"
library.</p>

<p>Because these implementations come from entirely different
codebases, and because the JAXP standard has evolved from 1.1 to
1.3, there are some subtle differences between the implementations,
even they both conform to the JAXP standard. These two factors
combine to create the compatibility issues described in this
guide.</p>

<h2><a name="new" id="new"></a>What's New</h2>

<p>However, while XML applications written for 1.4 do suffer some
incompatibilities, JAXP 1.3 in the Java SE 5 platform provides some compelling advantages:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A built-in validation processor for <a href="http://www.w3.org/XML/Schema">XML Schema</a>.</li>
  <li>The ability to use other schema validators, as well, with the
    <code><a href="../../../../api/javax/xml/validation/package-summary.html">javax.xml.validation</a></code> package.</li>
  <li>A thorough implementation of XML Schema data types in
    <code><a href="../../../../api/javax/xml/datatype/package-summary.html">javax.xml.datatype</a></code>,
    including Gregorian Calendar dates and times that previously had no
    natural analogues in the Java platform.</li>
  <li>XSLTC, the fast, compiling transformer, which is now the default engine for XSLT processing.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.w3.org/DOM/">DOM Level 3</a> core, which provides:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xml11/">XML 1.1</a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-names11/">Namespaces 1.1</a>
        (<code><a href="../../../../api/javax/xml/namespace/package-summary.html">javax.xml.namespace</a></code>),
        which provide better support for Unicode characters in tag names
        and namespaces.</li>
      <li>Support for normalization of documents</li>
      <li>Support for schema data types (<code>TypeInfo</code>)</li>
      <li>Better <code>ErrorHandling</code> and identification of an error's location</li>
      <li>Bootstrapping. DOMLevel 3 supports implementation independent way to obtain
        <code>DOMImplementation</code>.</li>
      <li>DOMLevel 3 allows setting of application data in a node, also allows
        setting of <code>UserDataHandler</code> which gets called
        whenever a node is cloned, removed, renamed.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Java-Centric <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath/">XPath</a>
    APIs in <code><a href="../../../../api/javax/xml/xpath/package-summary.html">javax.xml.xpath</a></code>,
    which provide a more java-friendly way to use an XPath expression.
    It was designed to be applicable to any data model that implements
    the interface. You can use it now to process the reference
    implementation DOM. In the future, it is likely to be available
    when processing a JDom, or STAX data model, as well.</li>
  <li>An implementation of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xinclude/">XInclude</a>, which makes it
    possible to build a document using text or XML stored in reusable
    segments elsewhere.</li>
  <li>Grammar pre-parsing and caching, which has a major impact on
    performance for high-volume XML processing.</li>
  <li>APIs that tell you implementation and version of the parser, so
    that when you install new libraries you can make sure the
   application is using them.</li>
</ul>
  
<p>That's the good news. The bad news is that some compatibility
issues have survived all attempts at eradication. The remainder of
this document discusses those issues.</p>

<h2><a name="dom" id="dom"></a>DOM Level 3</h2>

<p>While the reference implementation in Java SE 1.4 supported the DOM
Level 2 API, the implementation in Java SE 5 supports the DOM Level 3
family of APIs. This section covers the impact of those changes on
programs that used the JAXP 1.1 reference implementation:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="#addedMethods">Methods added to DOM interfaces</a></li>
  <li><a href="#preserving">Preserving the XML format</a></li>
</ul>

<p>For more information, see the complete list of changes in the
DOM Level 3 <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Core/changes.html">Changes</a>
appendix.</p>

<h3><a name="addedMethods" id="addedMethods"></a>Methods added to DOM interfaces</h3>

<p>In DOM level 3, additional methods were defined in the following
interfaces:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Attr</li>
  <li>Document</li>
  <li>DOMImplementation</li>
  <li>Element</li>
  <li>Entity</li>
  <li>Node</li>
  <li>Text</li>
</ul>

<p>The added methods only affect applications that implement the
interfaces directly, and only then when the application is
recompiled. Applications that use the factory methods to obtain
implementation classes for these interfaces will have no
problems.</p>

<h3><a name="preserving" id="preserving"></a>Preserving the XML format</h3>

<p>These changes affect an application that reads in XML data into
a DOM, makes modifications, and then writes it out in a way that
preserves the original formatting.</p>

<p>In JAXP 1.1, extraneous whitespace was automatically removed on
input, and a single property (<code>ignoringLexicalInfo</code>) was set to <code>false</code> to preserve entity nodes and CDATA nodes, for
example. Including the additional nodes made the DOM somewhat more
complex to process, but because they were there, adding whitespace
output (indentation and newlines) produced highly readable,
formatted version of the XML data which closely approximated the
input.</p>

<p>In JAXP 1.3, there are four APIs that the application uses to
determine how much lexical (formatting) information is available to
process, using the following <code>DocumentBuilderFactory</code> methods:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>setCoalescing()</code> &ndash; To convert CDATA nodes to Text node and append to an adjacent Text node (if any).</li>
  <li><code>setExpandEntityReferences()</code> &ndash; To expand entity reference nodes.</li>
  <li><code>setIgnoringComments()</code> &ndash; To ignore comments.</li>
  <li><code>setIgnoringElementContentWhitespace()</code> &ndash; To ignore whitespace that is not a significant part of element content.</li>
</ul>

<p>The default values for all of these properties is <code>false</code>, which preserves all the lexical information
necessary to reconstruct the incoming document in its original
form. Setting them all to <code>true</code> lets you
construct the simplest possible DOM, so the application can focus
on the data's semantic content, without having to worry about
lexical syntax details.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> When adding new nodes, the application must add any indentation and
newline formatting that is needed for readability, since it is not
provided automatically.</p>

<h2><a name="SAX2" id="SAX2">SAX 2.0.2</a></h2>

<p>Following are the changes made between SAX 2.0.0 and SAX 2.0.2
that might affect compatibility:</p>

<ul>

  <li><code>DeclHandler.externalEntityDecl</code> now requires the
    parser to return the absolute system identifier for consistency
    with <code>DTDHandler.unparsedEntityDecl</code>. This may
    cause some incompatibilities.</li>
    
  <li>
    <p>In SAX 2.0.1, an application can set <code>ErrorHandler</code>, <code>EntityResolver</code>, <code>ContentHandler</code>, or <code>DTDHandler</code> to <code>null</code>. This
      is a relaxation of the previous restriction in SAX 2.0, which
      generated a <code>NullPointerException</code> (NPE)
      in such circumstances.</p>
      
    <p>So the following code is legal in JAXP 1.3:</p>

<pre class="codeblock">SAXParserFactory spf = SAXParserFactory.newInstance();
SAXParser sp = spf.newSAXParser();
XMLReader reader = sp.getXMLReader();
    
reader.setErrorHandler(<strong>null</strong>);
reader.setContentHandler(<strong>null</strong>);
reader.setEntityResolver(<strong>null</strong>);
reader.setDTDHandler(<strong>null</strong>);</pre>
  </li>
    
  <li>
    <p><a name="entityResolver" id="entityResolver"/>The <code>resolveEntity()</code> method in the
      <code>EntityResolver</code> API now throws
      <code>IOException</code>, as well as <code>SAXException</code>. (Before, it only threw <code>SAXException</code>.)</p>

    <p>The vast majority of applications are unaffected by this change,
      because the <code>DefaultHandler</code>
      implementation class has been modified to declare the additional
      exception, and very few applications use the <code>DefaultHandler</code> in such a way that they will run into
      a problem.</p>

    <p>The only way an application can be affected is if it overrides
      the <code>resolveEntity()</code> method and
      <em>also</em> invokes <code>super.resolveEntity()</code>. In that case, the application
      won't compile in Java SE 5 until the method is modified to handle an 
      <code>IOException</code> that <code>super.resolveEntity()</code>
      could throw.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>The following new features are recognized:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>http://xml.org/sax/features/external-general-entities</code> &ndash; To include external general entities.</li>
      <li><code>http://xml.org/sax/features/external-parameter-entities</code> &ndash; To include external parameter entities and the external DTD
subset.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>and the following new property:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><code>http://xml.org/sax/properties/xml-string</code> &ndash; To
        get the string of characters associated with the current
       event.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>For a complete list of Xerces features and properties, see
      <a href="http://xerces.apache.org/xerces2-j/features.html">http://xml.apache.org/xerces2-j/features.html</a>
      and <a href="http://xerces.apache.org/xerces2-j/properties.html">http://xml.apache.org/xerces2-j/properties.html</a>.</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> One point of compatibility is also worth mentioning. Namespace
recognition was turned off by default in Java SE 1.4 (JAXP 1.1). For
backward compatibility, that policy is continued in Java SE 5 (JAXP
1.3). However, namespace recognition is turned <em>on</em> by
default in the official SAX implementation at <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/sax/">https://sourceforge.net/projects/sax/</a>. While not
strictly a compatibility issue from the standpoint of JAXP, it is
an issue that sometimes comes as a surprise.</p>

<h2><a name="invokingXSLT" id="invokingXSLT"></a>Invoking XSLT</h2>
<p>Code that uses the standard JAXP APIs to create and access an
XSL transformer does not need to be changed. The output will be the
same, but will in general be produced much faster, since the XSLTC
compiling transformer will be used by default, instead of the
interpreting Xalan transformer.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> There is no significant difference between Xalan and XSLTC
performance for a single run on a small data set, as when you are
developing and testing an XSL stylesheet. But there is a major
performance benefit when using XSLTC on anything larger.</p>

<h3><a name="xsltXpath" id="xsltXpath"></a>Programmatic Access to Xalan XPath</h3>

<p>JAXP 1.3 provides the standard XPath API for evaluating XPath
expressions.&nbsp; We encourage users to use this API.
Xalan-interpretive is not included in the reference implementation.
If an application explicitly uses the Xalan XPath API to evaluate a
standalone XPath expression (one that is not part of an XSLT
stylesheet), you'll need to download and install the Apache
libraries for Xalan, put them on the classpath.</p>

<h2><a name="packageNames" id="packageNames"></a>Package Name Changes</h2>

<p>This change does not affect applications that confine themselves
to using the standard JAXP APIs. But applications that access
implementation-specific features of the XML processors defined in
previous JAXP versions will have to be modified to take into
account package names that changed in JAXP 1.3.</p>

<p>The change has several effects on previous applications:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The property-values that were used to access the internal
    implementations must be changed.</li>
  <li>Applications that used internal APIs that from the Xalan
    implementation classes must change the import statements that gave
    them access to those APIs.</li>
  <li>Applications that used internal APIs from the Crimson
    implementation must be re-coded &ndash; ideally, by using newer JAXP APIs
    or, if necessary, by using Xerces APIs.</li>
</ol>

<h3><a name="packageNamesWhy" id="packageNamesWhy"></a>What Changed, and Why</h3>

<p>In Java SE 1.4, the fact that JAXP was built into the Java platform
was a mixed blessing. On the one hand, an application could rely on
that fact that it was there. On the other, most applications needed
features and bug fixes that were available in later versions.</p>
<p>But adding new libraries had no effect, because internal classes
always take precedence over the classpath. The solution for that
problem in 1.4 was to use the endorsed standards mechanism.
However, that was a new mechanism, and one which frequently placed
an additional burden on the end user, as well as the application
developer.</p>

<p>The solution in the JAXP 1.3 reference name is to change the
package names of the Apache libraries used in the implementation.
That change lets you reference newer Apache libraries in the
classpath, so application developers can use them in the same way
that would use any other additions to the Java platform.</p>
<p>The new names given to the Apache packages in the JAXP 1.3
reference implementation are shown below:</p>

<table summary="Apache package names">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td headers="h1">&nbsp;</td>
<td headers="h2">JAXP 1.1</td>
<td headers="h3">JAXP 1.3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td headers="h1">JAXP</td>
<td headers="h2"><code>org.apache.crimson<br/><br/></code></td>
<td headers="h3"><code>-/-<br/>com.sun.org.apache.xerces.internal</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td headers="h1">&nbsp;</td>
<td headers="h2"><code>org.apache.xml</code></td>
<td headers="h3"><code>com.sun.org.apache.xml.internal</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td headers="h1">XSLT</td>
<td headers="h2"><code>org.apache.xalan<br/>org.apache.xpath<br/>org.apache.xalan.xsltc<br/></code></td>
<td headers="h3"><code>com.sun.org.apache.xalan.internal<br/>com.sun.org.apache.xpath.internal<br/>com.sun.org.apache.xalan.internal.xsltc</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<h3><a name="packageNamesUsing" id="packageNamesUsing"></a>Using System Properties and Implementation Classes</h3>

<p>Applications that specifying system properties on the command
line with <code>-D</code>, in the JRE's <code>lib/jaxp.properties</code> file, or by hard-coding them
into the application, generally do so in order to access
functionality that is not present in the standard APIs.</p>

<p>JAXP 1.3 contains many new additions. When upgrading such
applications, it is advisable to look for standard APIs in the
<code>javax.xml.*</code> packages that will do the
same job, because that's the best way to keep from having to change
the application in the future. If absolutely necessary (either
because of functionality restrictions or lack of time to
investigate the new APIs), the property values can be changed by
converting old-format package names into the format:</p>

<p><code><strong>org.apache.somePackage</strong> &rarr; com.sun.<strong>org.apache.SomePackage</strong>.internal</code></p>

<p>Similarly, internal implementation classes all use the new
package names. If your application is using implementation classes
(it shouldn't!) those package names will have to change, as
well.</p>

<h2><a name="JAXP_security" id="JAXP_security"></a>Security Issue Posed by Nested Entity Definitions</h2>

<p>While XML does not allow recursive entity definitions, it does
permit nested entity definitions, which produces the potential for
Denial of Service attacks on a server which accepts XML data from
external sources. For example, a SOAP document like the following
that has very deeply nested entity definitions can consume 100% of
CPU time and large amounts of memory in entity expansions:</p>

<pre class="codeblock">&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding ="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE foobar[
  &lt;!ENTITY x100 "foobar"&gt;
  &lt;!ENTITY  x99 "&amp;x100;&amp;x100;"&gt;
  &lt;!ENTITY  x98 "&amp;x99;&amp;x99;"&gt;
  ...
  &lt;!ENTITY   x2 "&amp;x3;&amp;x3;"&gt;
  &lt;!ENTITY   x1 "&amp;x2;&amp;x2;"&gt;
]&gt;
  
&lt;SOAP-ENV:Envelope xmlns:SOAP-ENV=...&gt;
  &lt;SOAP-ENV:Body&gt;
    &lt;ns1:aaa xmlns:ns1="urn:aaa" SOAP-ENV:encodingStyle="..."&gt;
      &lt;foobar xsi:type="xsd:string"&gt;&amp;x1;&lt;/foobar&gt;
    &lt;/ns1:aaa&gt;
  &lt;/SOAP-ENV:Body&gt;
&lt;/SOAP-ENV:Envelope&gt;</pre>

<p>A system that doesn't take in external XML data need not be
concerned with the issue, but one that does can utilize one of the
following safeguards to prevent the problem:</p>

<ul>
  <li><p><b>New system property to limit entity expansion</b>: The <tt>entityExpansionLimit</tt> system property lets existing
    applications constrain the total number of entity expansions
    without recompiling the code. The parser throws a fatal error once
    it has reached the entity expansion limit. (By default, the limit
    is set to 64000.)</p>
    <p>To set the entity expansion limit using the system property, use an
    option like the following on the java command line: <tt>-DentityExpansionLimit=100000</tt></p></li>
  <li><p><b>New parser property to disallow DTDs</b>: The application can also set the
    <tt>http://apache.org/xml/features/disallow-doctype-decl</tt>
    parser property to true. A fatal error is then thrown if the
    incoming XML document contains a DOCTYPE declaration. (The default
    value for this property is false.) This property is typically
    useful for SOAP based applications where a SOAP message must not
    contain a Document Type Declaration.</p></li>
  <li><p><b>New feature for Secure Processing</b>: JAXP 1.3 includes a new <a href="../../../../api/javax/xml/XMLConstants.html#FEATURE_SECURE_PROCESSING">
    secure processing feature</a> in which an application can configure
    the <code><a href="../../../../api/javax/xml/parsers/SAXParserFactory.html#setFeature(java.lang.String,%20boolean)">SAXParserFactory</a></code>
    or <code><a href="../../../../api/javax/xml/parsers/DocumentBuilderFactory.html#setFeature(java.lang.String,%20boolean)">
    DocumentBuilderFactory</a></code> to get an XML processor that behaves in
    a secured fashion. Setting this feature to true sets the
    entity expansion limit to 64000. Note that the default limit
    can be increased using the <code>entityExpansionLimit</code> system
    property.</p></li>
</ul>
