<p class="pBody">In any system support must be provided for the
system to evolve over time. Most existing systems have conventions
and mechanisms that specify how change is accommodated. These
systems have been based on the model where software programs are
installed on a computer. Typically, developers have been able to
specify what versions of other packages are required and the
installation process has helped verify and configure the
system.</p>
<a name="wp91739" id="wp91739"></a>
<p class="pBody">In open distributed systems the static assumptions
of existing systems does not work and evolution is more difficult
because it is not possible to control how or when the packages
change and correct operation depends on a greater number of
dependencies between packages. What is needed is an updated set of
conventions and mechanisms that specify how the packages of a
system should evolve so that the goal of an open reliable scalable
distributed system can be achieved.</p>

<h2 class="pHeading1">1.3 Problems of Evolution in Distributed
Systems</h2>
<a name="wp90414" id="wp90414"></a>
<p class="pBody">In open distributed systems many problems can
occur when the packages evolve and are updated independently. If
the specified behavior inherent in the use of public interfaces are
not maintained the system may fail in unexpected ways. Open systems
are made up of many packages from different companies and
organizations. These organizations operate asynchronously,
introducing and upgrading their products on their own schedules.
The distribution of those upgraded products takes time and adoption
is not universal.</p>
<a name="wp90415" id="wp90415"></a>
<p class="pBody">In Java, the components of local and distributed
systems rely on the public interfaces and contracts for the
behavior of other packages. Those packages will themselves evolve
over time. In order for a package to operate correctly the packages
it depends on must continue to provide the expected behavior even
though they have been updated.</p>
<a name="wp90416" id="wp90416"></a>
<p class="pBody">In distributed systems only partial consistency is
possible, since it is impossible to have knowledge of the entire
state of the system. Each process and package of the system has its
own partial view of the current state of the system, accumulated
incrementally by requesting information from other parts of the
distributed system. Each piece of information whether from an
applet that was started, a class that was loaded, a remote method
invoked, or a web page retrieved must be treated carefully so that
it can be used consistently with the rest of that partial view.</p>
<a name="wp90417" id="wp90417"></a>
<p class="pBody">Many kinds of errors could result from
inconsistencies in the classes that are loaded, including class
verification errors, classes could compute incorrectly but without
recognizable errors, or user requested functions could exhibit
arbitrary failures.</p>
<a name="wp90418" id="wp90418"></a>
<p class="pBody">Typical problems include:</p>
<div style="margin-left: 2em" class="pBullet1"><a name="wp90419"
id="wp90419"></a>
<div class="pBullet1">
<ul>
<li>If an applet is running and has loaded only some of its classes
when the web server is updated with a new version. When the applet
incrementally loads more classes they may be inconsistent with the
classes already loaded.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<a name="wp90420" id="wp90420"></a>
<div class="pBullet1Plus">
<ul>
<li>If an application is using libraries from multiple websites and
has loaded only some of the classes it needs, the libraries might
be updated raising the potential of incompatibilities that the
applet or user is left to detect.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<a name="wp90421" id="wp90421"></a>
<div class="pBullet1Plus">
<ul>
<li>If an application or applet is running and makes a RMI call
that returns an object for which the class needs to be loaded. The
class that is loaded could be inconsistent with respect to the
other classes already loaded.</li>

</div>
<a name="wp90422" id="wp90422"></a>
<div class="pBullet1Plus">
<ul>
<li>If an application or applet is running and makes a RMI call

</ul>
</div>
<a name="wp90423" id="wp90423"></a>
<div class="pBullet1Last">
<ul>
<li>Bugs may exist in a library, if the clients have worked around
the bug a cascade of problems may be introduced when the bug is
fixed.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<a name="wp90408" id="wp90408"></a>
<p class="pBody">These problems cannot be prevented or solved
directly because they arise out of inconsistencies between
dynamically loaded packages that are not under the control of a
single system administrator and so cannot be addressed by current
configuration management techniques.</p>
<a name="wp90410" id="wp90410"></a>
<h2 class="pHeading1">1.4 Design for Evolution</h2>
<a name="wp90409" id="wp90409"></a>
<p class="pBody">The key to dealing with these problems and meeting
the requirements stated above is the careful design of the packages
and packaging of the system so that they may be updated,
distributed, and loaded in consistent units. Typical to mass
produced products is the notion of the field replacable unit. It is
the smallest unit of a product that can be identified with a
specification, a supplier, can be distributed and redistributed,
and can be replaced if faulty. This same model is used for software
distribution, products have a name, a version number, adhere to one
or more specifications, are distributed on the network or cdrom and
its problems can be reported to support organizations. These
packages are the smallest unit that can be distributed, used,
validated and replaced or upgraded when necessary. Packages can be
assembled with other packages and each package can still be
identified, verified, and distributed.</p>
<a name="wp90429" id="wp90429"></a>
<p class="pBody">The Java language based package mechanism fits
well with the idea of a replacable unit. Java packages expose only
public interfaces and use only the public interfaces of other
packages. The Java Language Specification define the approaches for
compatible evolution of packages.</p>
<a name="wp89343" id="wp89343"></a>
<h3 class="pHeading2">1.4.1 Java Language Specification on
Backwards Compatibility</h3>
<a name="wp89344" id="wp89344"></a>
<p class="pBody">The Java Language Specification lays the
groundwork for developing packages that can be expected to evolve
gracefully over time. It defines how classes can change and still
be backward compatible with other classes previously compiled and
distributed. Essential to robust evolution is the stability of the
public, protected, and package interfaces and behavior as the
implementations evolve. It defines &#8220;compatible&#8221; changes
as those changes that do not change existing interfaces or
behavior. Thus, if a class defines a method, and the method had a
particular behavior, that same contract must be supported by the
all later evolutions of the class. Detailed rules are given in
Chapter 13 of the Java Language Specification. One additional
incompatible change has been added; it is incompatible to add
methods to a public interface.</p>
<a name="wp89345" id="wp89345"></a>
<p class="pBody">Incompatible changes are not permitted, but new or
similar functionality can always be added in new or existing
interfaces or classes.</p>
<a name="wp89346" id="wp89346"></a>
<p class="pBody">By choosing the Java package as the unit of update
the package and private methods of the classes may change allowing
flexibility in the implementation of the package while the public
and protected classes and methods maintain the external interfaces
and semantics.</p>
<a name="wp89356" id="wp89356"></a>
<h3 class="pHeading2">1.4.2 Object Serialization Specification on
Backwards Compatibility</h3>
<a name="wp89357" id="wp89357"></a>
<p class="pBody">Robust persistent storage and robust communication
between the components is important to distributed systems.
Components must be able to maintain persistent storage as they
evolve, being able to evolve classes and yet have them read data
previously written to storage. Components in a distributed system
evolve at different rates and must still be able to reliably
communicate.</p>
<a name="wp89349" id="wp89349"></a>
<p class="pBody">Adhering to the compatibility requirements of
object serialization allows newer and older versions to communicate
in a predictable and consistent way. The details are in Chapter 5
of the Java<sup style="font-style: normal" class=
"cSuperscript">&#8482;</sup> Object Serialization
Specification.</p>
<a name="wp89936" id="wp89936"></a>
<h2 class="pHeading1">1.5 Package Version Specification</h2>
<a name="wp89937" id="wp89937"></a>
<p class="pBody">There are several categories of artifacts that
need to be identified including specifications, implementation, the
Java Virtual Machine and Java Runtime Environment.</p>
<a name="wp89938" id="wp89938"></a>
<h3 class="pHeading2">1.5.1 Specification Versioning</h3>
<a name="wp89939" id="wp89939"></a>
<p class="pBody">Open systems are based on the idea that a
specification may have multiple implementations. Specifications
evolve under the auspices of an organization or company. It is
highly undesirable if a specification has multiple incompatible
versions. Each version of a specification or implementation must
evolve only into a single subsequent version. The philosophy of
requiring specifications to be backward compatible allows
specifications to be identified as supersets of the previous
specification. Since there is a single sequence of version
specifications they can meaningfully be identified by version
numbers with specific semantics that imply the ordering.
Specification version numbers use a Dewey decimal notation
consisting of numbers seperated by periods.</p>
<a name="wp89940" id="wp89940"></a>
<p class="pBody">A specification is identified by the:</p>

information. A manifest entry should be created for each Java
package. The name of the entry will be the directory within the
archive that contains the package&#8217;s class and resource files.
For example:</p>
<div class="pPreformatted">
<pre class="pPreformatted">Manifest-Version: 1.0
Created-By: 1.8.0 (Oracle Corporation)
Name: java/util/
Specification-Title: Java Utility Classes

Implementation-Title: java.util 
Implementation-Version: build57
Implementation-Vendor: Example Tech, Inc.</pre></div>
<a name="wp90931" id="wp90931"></a>
<p class="pBody">These attributes can be inserted in the manifest
by creating a prototype manifest file and using the
&#8220;-m&#8221; switch of the jar tool to merge them into the

<h3 class="pHeading2">1.5.10 Rationale for limiting Implementation
version numbers to identity</h3>
<a name="wp90469" id="wp90469"></a>
<p class="pBody">Implementations evolve independently over time to
fix bugs, improve performance or add new functions called for by
later revisions of the specifications. Packages implement
specifications and must identify which version of each
specification they implement. Interactions occur between packages
only through their public and protected interfaces and classes. It
is the public api and behavior that must remain stable over time so
that changes can be allowed in the implementation of one package
without affecting the behavior of another package.</p>
<a name="wp90470" id="wp90470"></a>
<p class="pBody">If the classes of a package <em class=
"cEmphasis">always</em> faithfully implemented the specification it
would be sufficient just to identify the specification. Since in
the real world this rarely happens packages need to identify
themselves so that bugs can be reported against the packages that
may have contributed to the problem.</p>
<a name="wp90471" id="wp90471"></a>
<p class="pBody">There is a significant tendency to try to attach
some significance to version identifiers of implementations. If the
purpose is to allow the tracking of bugs then a unique number is
sufficient. It is also sufficient for a client package to
workaround a bug in a particular version of a vendors package since
that version can be tested for and the bug avoided.</p>
<a name="wp90472" id="wp90472"></a>
<p class="pBody">However, many additional problems can occur when
one package attempts to work around bugs in other packages. They
need to identify behavior that is not part of the specification and
may try to use behavior that is only part of one implementation.
Such implementation specific behavior cannot be relied upon to be
in any particular version other than the one(s) seen and tested by
the developer.</p>
<a name="wp90473" id="wp90473"></a>
<p class="pBody">A bug first appears in some version of a vendors
package and may or may not continue to be a problem in subsequent
versions. If the client of the buggy package uses a work around
based on version numbers it could correctly work around the bug in
the specific version. Now, if the buggy package was fixed, how
would the client package know whether the bug was fixed or not. If
it assumed that higher versions still contained the bug it would
still try to work around the bug. The work around itself might not
work correctly with the non-buggy package. This could cause a
cascade of bugs caused by fixing a bug. Only the developer, through
testing with a new version, can determine whether or not the
workaround for a bug is still necessary or whether it will cause
problems with the correctly behaving package. The developer only
knows that the bug exists in a particular individual versions.</p>
