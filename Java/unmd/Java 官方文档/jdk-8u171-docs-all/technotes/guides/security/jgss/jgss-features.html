<h2>Java Generic Security Services (Java GSS) and Kerberos
Enhancements for Java SE 7</h2>
<p>The following enhancements were added to the Java GSS/Kerberos implementation in Java SE 7.</p>
-->
<!-- insert new detailed copy here -->
<!-- 
<ul>
<li><b>Unbound GSS/Kerberos</b><br />
<br />
In today's virtualized world, a service might be serving clients from different networks by exposing different service names. For example, consider virtual hosts in a web server where a single httpd server can host two different domains, such as http://www.sun.com and http://www.oracle.com.
The Java SE 6 kerberos server design did not allow for this. It mandated a service principal. In Java SE 7, this is relaxed to allow multiple hostname/service binding. This is called unbound krb5.<br />
<br />
<li><b>Specific support for Krb5 Configuration Parameters</b><br />
<br />
In previous releases, it was not specifically stated which <code>krb5.conf</code> file parameters were supported by the Java GSS/Kerberos implementation. 
In Java SE 7, the following are the supported parameters. They are presented under specific sections of <code>krb5.conf</code>, such as <code>[libdefaults]</code>.
<br />
<pre>
[libdefaults]
default_realm
allow_weak_crypto
 
dns_lookup_kdc
dns_lookup_realm
dns_fallback
 
default_checksum
safe_checksum_type
ap_req_checksum_type
default_keytab_name
 
default_tkt_enctypes
permitted_enctypes
default_tgs_enctypes
 
no_addresses
noaddresses
 
renewable
proxiable
forwardable
 
kdc_default_options
clockskew
 
kdc_timeout
udp_preference_limit
 
[realms]
  REALM.NAME = {
    kdc =
  }
 
[capaths]
  A = {
    I = .
    B = I
  }
 
[domain_realm]
  domain=REALM
</pre>
<br />
Here are the defaults for the <code>krb5.conf</code> file parameters.<br />
<pre>
no_addresses = true
noaddresses = true
dns_fallback = true (false in JDK 6)
dns_lookup_kdc = true (false in JDK 6)
dns_lookup_realm = true (false in JDK 6)
allow_weak_crypto = true (new in JDK 7)
kdc_timeout = 30000
max_retries = 3
udp_preference_limit = -1
clockskew = 300
renewable = false
proxiable = false
forwardable = false

<h2>Java Generic Security Services API and Kerberos Enhancements
for Java SE 8</h2>
<p>The following enhancements were added to the Java GSS API and
Kerberos implementation in Java SE 8.</p>
<a name="MS-SFU" id="MS-SFU"></a>
<h3>MS-SFU Kerberos Extensions for JDK 8</h3>
<p>MS-SFU refers to Microsoft Kerberos 5 extensions that allow a
service to obtain a Kerberos service ticket on behalf of a client.
This is useful when the authentication between the client and this
service is not established through Kerberos (thus the standard
Kerberos delegation cannot be used) but the service needs to access
a Kerberos-secured back-end server in the name of the client.</p>
<p>Support for the MS-SFU extensions was added in JDK 8. This
includes support for the S4U2self and S4U2proxy protocols, as
defined in <a href=
"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc246071.aspx">MS-SFU</a>.</p>
<p>This feature is very useful in secure enterprise deployments.
For example, in a typical network service, the front end (such as a
web server) often needs to access the back end (such as a database
server) on behalf of a client. Normal Kerberos 5 supports
delegation, but demands that all layers in this chain explicitly
use Kerberos authentication at each step, which is not always
possible or desirable.</p>
<p>For example, if a client logs in to a web server using digest
authentication, then there are no Kerberos credentials to be
delegated, and normal step-by-step Kerberos 5 authentication cannot
occur. However, because MS-SFU defines the Service for User
(S4U2self) extension so that the front end can access the back end
on behalf of the client without presenting the client's Kerberos
credentials, MS-SFU could provide authentication in this
situation.</p>
<p>In addition, there are potential security gaps in the standard
Kerberos 5 delegation mechanism (which Microsoft calls <em>open
delegation</em>). In this mechanism, once the service account has
the client's delegated credentials, it has access to any service.
Thus, great care is needed with open delegation.</p>
<p>In contrast, the MS-SFU delegation (implemented in S4U2proxy) is
much more secure. Here the administrator can precisely control the
services to which a particular service can delegate. (Microsoft
calls this <em>constrained delegation</em>.)</p>
<a name="MS-SFUdetail" id="MS-SFUdetail"></a>
<h3>MS-SFU Implementation Details</h3>
<p>The original Kerberos 5 protocol was defined in RFC 4120. MS-SFU
adds two extensions to that protocol: Service for User to Self
(S4U2self), which allows a front-end service to obtain a Kerberos
service ticket to itself on behalf of a user, and Service for User
to Proxy (S4U2proxy), which enables it to obtain a service ticket
on behalf of the user to a second, back-end service.</p>
<p>Together, these two extensions enable the front-end service to
obtain a Kerberos service ticket on behalf of a user. The resulting
service ticket can be used to access other services on the local or
remote machines.</p>
<p>A new public method (<code>GSSCredential::impersonate</code>)
has been added to the <code>com.sun.security.jgss</code> package to
implement these extensions.</p>

<h2>Java Generic Security Services API and Kerberos Enhancements
for Java SE 6</h2>
<p>The following enhancements were added to the Java Generic
Security Services API (Java GSS) and Kerberos implementation in
Java SE 6.</p>
<!-- insert new detailed copy here -->
<ul>
<li><b>Support for AES encryption type</b><br />
<br />
Java SE 5.0 supports the DES and Triple DES encryption types, with
the following aliases:<br />
<br />
<code>des-cbc-md5<br />
des-cbc-crc<br />
des3-cbc-sha1<br />
<br /></code> Starting from Java SE 6, support for the AES
encryption type (AES128 and AES256Triple DES encryption type is
specified ) in Java GSS/Kerberos is available. This improves
interoperability of the Java SE Kerberos implementation with other
Kerberos implementations, such as Solaris 10 and MIT
Kerberos.<br />
<br />
The AES encryption type is specified in the Kerberos configuration
file under the <code>libdefaults</code> section. It is specified as
follows, with the following tags: <code>default_tkt_enctypes,
default_tgs_enctypes, permitted_enctypes.</code><br />
<br />
(AES128 encryption type)<br />
<br />
<code>aes128-cts<br />
aes128-cts-hmac-sha1-96<br />
<br /></code> (AES256 encryption type)<br />
<br />
<code>aes256-cts<br />
aes256-cts-hmac-sha1-96<br />
<br /></code> <b>NOTE:</b> The JCE framework within JDK includes an
ability to enforce restrictions regarding the cryptographic
algorithms and maximum cryptographic strengths available to
applications. Such restrictions are specified in "jurisdiction
policy files." The jurisdiction policy files bundled in Java SE
limit the maximum key length. Hence, to use the AES256 encryption
type, you will need to install the JCE crypto policy with the
unlimited version to allow AES with 256-bit key.<br />
<br />
For example, the <code>libdefaults</code> section in the
configuration file might include the following.<br />
<br />
<code>default_tkt_enctypes = aes128-cts des3-cbc-sha1 des-cbc-md5
des-cbc-crc<br />
default_tgs_enctypes = aes128-cts des3-cbc-sha1 des-cbc-md5
des-cbc-crc<br />
permitted_enctypes = aes128-cts des3-cbc-sha1 des-cbc-md5
des-cbc-crc<br />
<br /></code> <code>default_tkt_enctypes</code> is used to specify
the encryption types to use for the session key in the
ticket-granting-ticket. It is used by the client to restrict the
encryption types of session keys that will be used to communicate
with the KDC. The default value is <code>des-cbc-md5 des-cbc-crc
des3-cbc-sha1 aes128-cts</code> .<br />
<br />
<code>default_tgs_enctypes</code> is used to specify the encryption
types to use for the session key in service tickets. It is used by
the client to restrict the encryption types of session keys that
are shared by the client and server. The default value is
<code>des-cbc-md5 des-cbc-crc des3-cbc-sha1
aes128-cts</code>.<br />
<br />
<code>permitted_enctypes</code> is used to specify the encryption
types permitted to be used by a service. It is used by the server
to restrict the encryption types of session keys that it will
accept. The default value is <code>des-cbc-md5 des-cbc-crc
des3-cbc-sha1 aes128-cts</code>.</li>
<li><b>Support for RC4-HMAC encryption type</b><br />
<br />
Java SE 5.0 already supports DES and Triple DES encryption type,
with following aliases:<br />
<code>des-cbc-md5<br />
des-cbc-crc<br />
des3-cbc-sha1<br />
<br /></code> Starting from Java SE 6, support for the RC4-HMAC
encryption type in Java GSS/Kerberos is available. This improves
interoperability of the Java SE Kerberos implementation with other
Kerberos implementations, such as Windows, Solaris 10, and MIT
Kerberos. Windows Active Directory supports RC4-HMAC as the default
Kerberos encryption type.<br />
<br />
The RC4-HMAC encryption type is specified in the Kerberos
configuration file under the <code>libdefaults</code> section. It
is specified as follows, with the following tags:
<code>default_tkt_enctypes, default_tgs_enctypes,
permitted_enctypes.</code><br />
<br />
<code>rc4-hmac<br />
arcfour-hmac<br />
arcfour-hmac-md5<br />
<br /></code> For example, the libdefaults section in the
configuration file might include the following.<br />
<br />
<code>default_tkt_enctypes = aes128-cts des3-cbc-sha1 rc4-hmac
des-cbc-md5 des-cbc-crc<br />
default_tgs_enctypes = aes128-cts des3-cbc-sha1 rc4-hmac
des-cbc-md5 des-cbc-crc<br />
permitted_enctypes = aes128-cts des3-cbc-sha1 rc4-hmac des-cbc-md5
des-cbc-crc<br />
<br /></code> <code>default_tkt_enctypes</code> is used to specify
the encryption types to use for the session key in the
ticket-granting-ticket. It is used by the client to restrict the
encryption types of session keys that will be used to communicate
with the KDC. The default value is <code>des-cbc-md5 des-cbc-crc
rc4-hmac des3-cbc-sha1 aes128-cts</code><br />
<br />
<code>default_tgs_enctypes</code> is used to specify the encryption
types to use for the session key in service tickets. It is used by
the client to restrict the encryption types of session keys that
are shared by the client and server. The default value is
<code>des-cbc-md5 des-cbc-crc rc4-hmac des3-cbc-sha1
aes128-cts</code>.<br />
<br />
<code>permitted_enctypes</code> is used to specify the encryption
types permitted to be used by a service. It is used by the server
to restrict the encryption types of session keys that it will
accept. The default value is <code>des-cbc-md5 des-cbc-crc rc4-hmac
des3-cbc-sha1 aes128-cts</code>.<br />
<br />
<!-- ======================================= --></li>
<li><b>Support for SPNEGO in the Java GSS API</b><br />
<br />
Java SE now supports SPNEGO mechanism in the Java GSS API.<br />
<br />
The Java GSS API is a framework that can support multiple security
mechanisms; however GSS-API does not prescribe the method by which
peers can establish whether they have a common security mechanism.
The Simple and Protected GSS-API Negotiation (SPNEGO) mechanism is
a pseudo security mechanism that enables GSS-API peers to securely
negotiate a common security mechanism to be used. The SPNEGO
protocol is used to negotiate which security mechanism should be
adopted.<br />
<br />
Currently Java GSS applications specify a unique object identifier
(OID) to select the underlying security mechanism. For example,
Java GSS applications specify the <code>OID
"1.2.840.113554.1.2.2</code> to use the Kerberos mechanism. This
would be coded as follows:<br />
<code>Oid mechOid = new Oid("1.2.840.113554.1.2.2");</code><br />
<br />
To select the SPNEGO security mechanism, Java GSS applications
would need to specify the SPNEGO mechanism <code>OID
"1.3.6.1.5.5.2".</code> <code>Oid mechOid = new
Oid("1.3.6.1.5.5.2);</code><br />
<br />
Support for SPNEGO improves interoperability with Microsoft
products. The SPNEGO protocol is heavily used to interoperate with
Microsoft server over HTTP, to support HTTP-Based Cross-Platform
Authentication via the Negotiate Protocol. Java SE now supports the
SPNEGO authentication scheme in HTTP as well. Check the list of new
networking features for Java SE 6.<br />
<br />
<!-- ======================================= --></li>
<li><b>Support for new pre-authentication mechanisms</b><br />
<br />
Java SE now includes support for the new pre-authentication
mechanisms.<br />
<br />
Kerberos is a protocol for verifying the identity of principals.
The Kerberos protocol provides a mechanism called
pre-authentication for proving the identity of a principal and for
better protecting the long-term secret of the principal.<br />
<br />
The Kerberos specification defines a framework for Kerberos
pre-authentication mechanisms. The latest Kerberos specification
defines new pre-authentication mechanisms to notify the client
which key to use, salt updates, and other additional parameters.
The new pre-authentication mechanisms indicate a requirement for
additional pre-authentication.<br />
<br />
With the support of new pre-authentication mechanisms, Java
GSS/Kerberos client can now handle the salt value updates when
required.<br />
<br />
<!-- ======================================= --></li>
<li><b>Native platform GSS integration</b><br />
<p>This feature allows Java applications to take advantage of
features in native GSS implementation available on the platform. To
enable Java GSS to delegate to the native GSS library and its list
of native mechanisms, set the system property
"sun.security.jgss.native" to true. When enabled, Java GSS would
look for a native GSS library using the operating system-specific
name. For example, for Solaris, libgss.so or for Linux,
libgssapi.so. If the desired GSS library has a different name or is
not located under a directory for system libraries, then its full
path should be specified using the system property
"sun.security.jgss.lib".</p>
<p>For Java SE 6, native GSS support is limited to Solaris and
Linux. Setting these system properties on platforms where native
GSS integration is not supported will be ignored.</p>
<p>Unlike the default Java GSS implementation, which relies on the
JAAS KerberosLoginModule for initial credential acquisition, when
using native GSS, the initial credential should be acquired
beforehand. That is, call kinit prior to calling JGSS APIs.</p>
<p>In addition, when performing operations as a particular Subject,
for example, Subject.doAs(...) or Subject.doAsPrivileged(...), the
to-be-used GSSCredential should be added to Subject's private
credential set. Otherwise, the GSS operations will fail since no
credential is found.<br /></p>
</li>
<li><b>JAAS Login Entry Names Changes</b><br />
<br />
The JAAS login entry names for both SunJSSE and JGSS are unified,
and can be specified separately for different mechanisms. For
Kerberos 5, the names are
<pre>
com.sun.security.jgss.krb5.initiate
com.sun.security.jgss.krb5.accept

</pre></li>
</ul>

<h2>Java Generic Security Services API and Kerberos Enhancements
for Java SE 5.0</h2>
<!--

Fixed 4837364: KerberosLoginModule should support TGT renews
Fixed 4642044: add SunJSSE support for the Kerberos cipher suites
        (com.sun.net.ssl.client/com.sun.net.ssl.server index names
        for Krb5LoginModule)
-->
<p>The following enhancements were added to the Java Generic
Security Services API (Java GSS) and Kerberos implementation in
Java SE 5.0.</p>
<a name="tripledes" id="tripledes"></a>
<ul>
<li><b>Support for Triple DES encryption type</b><br />
Prior to Java SE 5.0, only the DES encryption type was supported.
Java SE 5.0 supports both DES and Triple DES encryption types. This
improves interoperability of the Java SE Kerberos implementation
with other Kerberos implementations, such as Solaris 10 and MIT
Kerberos.
<p>The Triple DES encryption type is specified in the Kerberos
configuration file under the "<tt>libdefaults</tt>" section. It is
specified as "<tt>des3-cbc-sha1</tt>" with the following tags:
<tt>default_tkt_enctypes</tt>, <tt>default_tgs_enctypes</tt>,
<tt>permitted_enctypes</tt>. "<tt>dec3-cbc-sha1</tt>" has the
following aliases:</p>
<pre>
des3-hmac-sha1
des3-cbc-sha1-kd
des3-cbc-hmac-sha1-kd

</pre>
For example, the libdefaults section in the configuration file
might include the following.
<pre>
default_tkt_enctypes = des3-cbc-sha1 des-cbc-md5 des-cbc-crc
default_tgs_enctypes = des3-cbc-sha1 des-cbc-md5 des-cbc-crc
permitted_enctypes   = des3-cbc-sha1 des-cbc-md5 des-cbc-crc

</pre>
<tt>default_tkt_enctypes</tt> is used to specify the encryption
types to use for the session key in the ticket-granting-ticket. It
is used by the client to restrict the encryption types of session
keys that will be used to communicate with the KDC. The default
value is "<tt>des-cbc-md5 des-cbc-crc des3-cbc-sha1</tt>".
<p><tt>default_tgs_enctypes</tt> is used to specify the encryption
types to use for the session key in service tickets. It is used by
the client to restrict the encryption types of session keys that
are shared by the client and server. The default value is
"<tt>des-cbc-md5 des-cbc-crc des3-cbc-sha1</tt>".</p>
<p><tt>permitted_enctypes</tt> is used to specify the encryption
types permitted to be used by a service. It is used by the server
to restrict the encryption types of session keys that it will
accept. The default value is "<tt>des-cbc-md5 des-cbc-crc
des3-cbc-sha1</tt>".</p>
</li>
<li><b>TCP vs. UDP Preference Configuration</b><br />
Java SE now supports the use of the "<tt>udp_preference_limit</tt>"
property in the Kerberos configuration file (<tt>krb5.conf</tt>).
<p>When sending a message to the KDC, the Java SE Kerberos library
will use TCP if the size of the message is larger than
<tt>udp_preference_list</tt>. If the message is smaller than
<tt>udp_preference_list</tt>, then UDP will be tried at most three
times. If the KDC indicates that the request is too big, the Java
SE Kerberos library will use TCP.</p>
</li>
<li><b>IPv6 Support in Kerberos</b><br />
Java SE now supports IPv6 addresses in Kerberos tickets. Prior to
Java SE 5, only IPv4 addresses were supported in tickets.</li>
<li><strong>TGT Renewals</strong><br />
The <a href=
"http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/jaas/index.html">Java
Authentication and Authorizaton Server (JAAS)</a> Kerberos login
module in JDK 5.0, <a href=
"../../../../jre/api/security/jaas/spec/com/sun/security/auth/module/Krb5LoginModule.html">
<tt>Krb5LoginModule</tt></a>, now supports Ticket Granting Ticket
(TGT) renewal. This allows long-running services to renew their TGT
automatically without user interaction or requiring the services to
restart.
<p>With this feature, if <tt>Krb5LoginModule</tt> obtains an
expired ticket from the ticket cache, then the TGT will be
automatically renewed and be added to Subject of the caller who
requested the ticket. If the ticket cannot be renewed for any
reason, then <tt>Krb5LoginModule</tt> will use its configured
callback handler to retrieve a username and password to acquire a
new TGT.</p>
<p>To use this feature, configure <tt>Krb5LoginModule</tt> to use
the ticket cache and set the newly introduced <tt>renewTGT</tt>
option to <tt>true</tt>. Here is an example of a JAAS login
configuration file that requests TGT renewal.</p>
<pre>
server {
  com.sun.security.auth.module.Krb5LoginModule required
        principal=<em>principal@your_realm</em>
        useTicketCache=true
        renewTGT=true;
};

</pre>
Note that if <tt>renewTGT</tt> is set to true, then
<tt>useTicketCache</tt> must also be set to true; otherwise, it
results in a configuration error.</li>
<li><strong>Login Entry Names for SunJSSE</strong><br />
In JDK 5.0, the SunJSSE provider has added support for the Kerberos
cipher suites, as described in <a href=
"http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2712.txt">RFC 2712</a> and the section
<a href="../jsse/JSSERefGuide.html#KRBRequire">Kerberos
Requirements</a> in the JSSE Reference Guide. The following JAAS
login configuration index names are reserved for this feature.
<pre>
com.sun.net.ssl.server
com.sun.net.ssl.client
</pre>
When a JSSE application uses the Kerberos cipher suites without an
explicit JAAS program, the SunJSSE provider will use these index
names to find and configure the JAAS login module to acquire the
necessary Kerberos credentials. For example, such an application
might have the following JAAS configuration file.
<pre>
 com.sun.net.ssl.server {
  com.sun.security.auth.module.Krb5LoginModule required
        principal=<em>service_principal@your_realm</em>
        useKeyTab=true
        keyTab=<em>keytab_name</em>
        storeKey=true;
};

</pre>
If the entry is not found, then the default "other" index name will
be used. The service name for TLS is "host". For example, a TLS
service running on a machine named "raven.example.com" in the realm
named "KRBNT-OPERATIONS.EXAMPLE.COM" would have the service
principal name
<pre>
host/raven.example.com@KRBNT-OPERATIONS.EXAMPLE.COM

</pre>
There are no restrictions on the TLS client; it may use any valid
Kerberos principal name.
<p>When a JSSE application uses the Kerberos cipher suites with an
explicit JAAS program, it can use any index name, including the
ones listed previously.</p>

<h2>New Features in Java GSS for Java 2 SDK, Standard Edition, v
1.4.2</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Configurable Kerberos Settings</b><br />
The Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC) name and realm settings
are provided in the Kerberos configuration file or via the system
properties <code>java.security.krb5.kdc</code> and
<code>java.security.krb5.realm</code>. In previous releases,
changes to the Kerberos configuration values would only take effect
when an application was restarted.
<p>In the 1.4.2 release of the Java platform, a new boolean option
<code>refreshKrb5Config</code> can be specified in the entry for
<code>Krb5LoginModule</code> in the JAAS configuration file. If
this option is set to <code>true</code>, then the configuration
values will be refreshed before the <code>login</code> method of
the <code>Krb5LoginModule</code> is called.</p>
</li>
<li><b>Support for Slave Kerberos Key Distribution Center</b><br />
Kerberos allows the use of slave KDCs so that if the master KDC is
unavailable, the slave KDCs will respond to user requests. In
earlier releases of Java SE, Sun's implementation of Kerberos tried
only the master KDC and would give up if there was no response
within the default KDC timeout specified in the Kerberos
configuration file, or 30 seconds if no timeout had been specified.
<p>With this 1.4.2 release, Sun's implementation of Kerberos will
retry with the slave KDCs, if they are specified. The slave KDCs
can be specified in the Kerberos configuration file or via a list
of KDCs separated by a colon (<code>:</code>) in the system
property <code>java.security.krb5.kdc</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><b>Support TCP for Kerberos Key Distribution Center
Transport</b><br />
Sun's implementation of Kerberos implements Kerberos version 5
according to <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1510.txt">RFC
1510</a> and uses UDP transport for ticket requests. A new Internet
draft updates this RFC. One of the added features is required
support for TCP as a transport in addition to UDP. As a result, in
cases where Kerberos tickets exceed the UDP packet size limit, the
KDC would return an error code indicating that the request should
be resent over TCP.
<p>In the current 1.4.2 release, Sun's implementation of Kerberos
now supports automatic fallback to TCP. Therefore, if the Kerberos
ticket request using UDP fails and the KDC returns the error code
<code>KRB_ERR_RESPONSE_TOO_BIG</code>, then TCP is automatically
the default transport. <!-- <P>
    The current draft which updates RFC 1510, is available online:

<li><b>Kerberos Service Ticket in the Subject's Private
Credentials</b><br />
The Kerberos service ticket is now stored in the Subject's private
credentials. This change allows application developers access to
the service ticket so that it can be used outside the JGSS (for
example, in native applications or for proprietary uses). In
addition, the service ticket can now be reused if the application
tries to establish a security context to the same service again.
The service ticket should be valid for it to be reusable.
<p>Previously, when using Java Generic Security Services API (JGSS)
over Kerberos V5, if the <code>
<!-- <a href="/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/org/ietf/jgss/package-summary.html"> -->
useSubjectCredsOnly <!-- </A> --></code> property was set to true,
then the Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) was retrieved from the
Subject and used to establish a GSS Security context. The service
ticket obtained was not stored in the Subject. Now the service
ticket is also stored in the Subject if
<code>useSubjectCredsOnly</code> is true.</p>
<p>If a client application searches through the Subject's private
credentials, in previous releases it would find only the TGT. As of
this release, it also will find any Service tickets obtained.</p>
<p>The bug report associated with this change is 4688866.</p>
