/**
 * A sample server application that uses JGSS to do mutual authentication
 * with a client using Kerberos as the underlying mechanism. It then
 * exchanges data securely with the client.
 *
 * Every message exchanged with the client includes a 4-byte application-
 * level header that contains the big-endian integer value for the number
 * of bytes that will follow as part of the JGSS token.
 *
 * The protocol is:
 *    1.  Context establishment loop:
 *         a. client sends init sec context token to server
 *         b. server sends accept sec context token to client
 *         ....
 *    2. client sends a wrap token to the server.
 *    3. server sends a wrap token back to the client.
 *
 * Start GssServer first before starting GssClient.
 *
 * Usage:  java <options> GssServer
 *
 * Example: java -Djava.security.auth.login.config=jaas-krb5.conf \
 *               GssServer
 *
 * Add -Djava.security.krb5.conf=krb5.conf to specify application-specific
 * Kerberos configuration (different from operating system's Kerberos
 * configuration).
