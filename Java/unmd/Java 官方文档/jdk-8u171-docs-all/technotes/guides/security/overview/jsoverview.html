<h1>Java&trade; Security Overview</h1>

<h2>1 Introduction</h2>

<p>The Java&trade; platform was designed with a strong emphasis on
security. At its core, the Java language itself is type-safe and
provides automatic garbage collection, enhancing the robustness of
application code. A secure class loading and verification mechanism
ensures that only legitimate Java code is executed.</p>

<p>The initial version of the Java platform created a safe
environment for running potentially untrusted code, such as Java
applets downloaded from a public network. As the platform has grown
and widened its range of deployment, the Java security architecture
has correspondingly evolved to support an increasing set of
services. Today the architecture includes a large set of
application programming interfaces (APIs), tools, and
implementations of commonly-used security algorithms, mechanisms,
and protocols. This provides the developer a comprehensive security
framework for writing applications, and also provides the user or
administrator a set of tools to securely manage applications.</p>

<p>The Java security APIs span a wide range of areas. Cryptographic
and public key infrastructure (PKI) interfaces provide the
underlying basis for developing secure applications. Interfaces for
performing authentication and access control enable applications to
guard against unauthorized access to protected resources.</p>

<p>The APIs allow for multiple interoperable implementations of
algorithms and other security services. Services are implemented in
<i>providers</i>, which are plugged into the Java platform via a
standard interface that makes it easy for applications to obtain
security services without having to know anything about their
implementations. This allows developers to focus on how to
integrate security into their applications, rather than on how to
actually implement complex security mechanisms.</p>

<p>The Java platform includes a number of providers that implement
a core set of security services. It also allows for additional
custom providers to be installed. This enables developers to extend
the platform with new security mechanisms.</p>

<p>This paper gives a broad overview of security in the Java
platform, from secure language features to the security APIs,
tools, and built-in provider services, highlighting key packages
and classes where applicable. Note that this paper is based on
Java&trade; SE version 8.</p>

<h2>2 Java Language Security and Bytecode Verification</h2>

<p>The Java language is designed to be type-safe and easy to use.
It provides automatic memory management, garbage collection, and
range-checking on arrays. This reduces the overall programming
burden placed on developers, leading to fewer subtle programming
errors and to safer, more robust code.</p>

<p>In addition, the Java language defines different access
modifiers that can be assigned to Java classes, methods, and
fields, enabling developers to restrict access to their class
implementations as appropriate. Specifically, the language defines
four distinct access levels: <code>private</code>,
<code>protected</code>, <code>public</code>, and, if unspecified,
<code>package</code>. The most open access specifier is
<code>public</code> access is allowed to anyone. The most
restrictive modifier is <code>private</code> access is not allowed
outside the particular class in which the private member (a method,
for example) is defined. The <code>protected</code> modifier allows
access to any subclass, or to other classes within the same
package. Package-level access only allows access to classes within
the same package.</p>

<p>A compiler translates Java programs into a machine-independent
bytecode representation. A bytecode verifier is invoked to ensure
that only legitimate bytecodes are executed in the Java runtime. It
checks that the bytecodes conform to the Java Language
Specification and do not violate Java language rules or namespace
restrictions. The verifier also checks for memory management
violations, stack underflows or overflows, and illegal data
typecasts. Once bytecodes have been verified, the Java runtime
prepares them for execution.</p>
<!-- BEGIN SECTION 3 -->

<h2>3 Basic Security Architecture</h2>

<p>The Java platform defines a set of APIs spanning major security
areas, including cryptography, public key infrastructure,
authentication, secure communication, and access control. These
APIs allow developers to easily integrate security into their
application code. They were designed around the following
principles:</p>

<dl>
<dt><i>Implementation independence</i></dt>
<dd>Applications do not need to implement security themselves.
Rather, they can request security services from the Java platform.
Security services are implemented in providers (see below), which
are plugged into the Java platform via a standard interface. An
application may rely on multiple independent providers for security
functionality.</dd>
<dt><i>Implementation interoperability</i></dt>
<dd>Providers are interoperable across applications. Specifically,
an application is not bound to a specific provider, and a provider
is not bound to a specific application.</dd>
<dt><i>Algorithm extensibility</i></dt>
<dd>The Java platform includes a number of built-in providers that
implement a basic set of security services that are widely used
today. However, some applications may rely on emerging standards
not yet implemented, or on proprietary services. The Java platform
supports the installation of custom providers that implement such
services.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Security Providers</h3>

<p>The <code>java.security.Provider</code> class encapsulates the
notion of a security provider in the Java platform. It specifies
the provider's name and lists the security services it implements.
Multiple providers may be configured at the same time, and are
listed in order of preference. When a security service is
requested, the highest priority provider that implements that
service is selected.</p>

<p>Applications rely on the relevant <code>getInstance</code>
method to obtain a security service from an underlying provider.
For example, message digest creation represents one type of service
available from providers. (Section 4 discusses message digests and
other cryptographic services.) An application invokes the
<code>getInstance</code> method in the
<code>java.security.MessageDigest</code> class to obtain an
implementation of a specific message digest algorithm, such as
SHA-256.</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA-256");
</pre>

<p>The program may optionally request an implementation from a
specific provider, by indicating the provider name, as in the
following:</p>

<pre class="codeblock">
MessageDigest md = 
    MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA-256", "ProviderC");
</pre>

<p>Figures 1 and 2 illustrate these options for requesting an
SHA-256 message digest implementation. Both figures show three
providers that implement message digest algorithms. The providers
are ordered by preference from left to right (1-3). In Figure 1, an
application requests an SHA-256 algorithm implementation without
specifying a provider name. The providers are searched in
preference order and the implementation from the first provider
supplying that particular algorithm, ProviderB, is returned. In
Figure 2, the application requests the SHA-256 algorithm
implementation from a specific provider, ProviderC. This time the
implementation from that provider is returned, even though a
provider with a higher preference order, ProviderB, also supplies
an SHA-256 implementation.</p>

</tr>

</tr>
</table>

<p>The Java platform implementation from Oracle includes a number
of pre-configured default providers that implement a basic set of
security services that can be used by applications. Note that other
vendor implementations of the Java platform may include different
sets of providers that encapsulate vendor-specific sets of security
services. When this paper mentions built-in default providers, it
is referencing those available in Oracle's implementation.</p>
<p>The sections below on the various security areas (cryptography,
authentication, etc.) each include descriptions of the relevant
services supplied by the default providers. A table in Appendix C
summarizes all of the default providers.</p>

<h3>File Locations</h3>
<p>Certain aspects of Java security mentioned in this paper,
including the configuration of providers, may be customized by
setting security properties. You may set security properties
statically in the security properties file, which by default is the
<i>java.security</i> file in the <i>lib/security</i> directory of
the directory where the Java&trade; Runtime Environment (JRE) is
installed. Security properties may also be set dynamically by
calling appropriate methods of the <code>Security</code> class (in
the <code>java.security</code> package).</p>
<p>The tools and commands mentioned in this paper are all in the
<code>~jre/bin</code> directory, where <code>~jre</code> stands for
the directory in which the JRE is installed. The <i>cacerts</i>
file mentioned in Section 5 is in
<code>~jre/lib/security</code>.</p>
<!-- END SECTION 3 -->

<h2>4 Cryptography</h2>

<p>The Java cryptography architecture is a framework for accessing
and developing cryptographic functionality for the Java platform.
It includes APIs for a large variety of cryptographic services,
including</p>

<ul>
<li>Message digest algorithms</li>
<li>Digital signature algorithms</li>
<li>Symmetric bulk encryption</li>
<li>Symmetric stream encryption</li>
<li>Asymmetric encryption</li>
<li>Password-based encryption (PBE)</li>
<li>Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)</li>
<li>Key agreement algorithms</li>
<li>Key generators</li>
<li>Message Authentication Codes (MACs)</li>
<li>(Pseudo-)random number generators</li>
</ul>

<p>For historical (export control) reasons, the cryptography APIs
are organized into two distinct packages. The
<code>java.security</code> package contains classes that are
<i>not</i> subject to export controls (like <code>Signature</code>
and <code>MessageDigest</code>). The <code>javax.crypto</code>
package contains classes that are subject to export controls (like
<code>Cipher</code> and <code>KeyAgreement</code>).</p>

<p>The cryptographic interfaces are provider-based, allowing for
multiple and interoperable cryptography implementations. Some
providers may perform cryptographic operations in software; others
may perform the operations on a hardware token (for example, on a
smartcard device or on a hardware cryptographic accelerator).
Providers that implement export-controlled services must be
digitally signed.</p>

<p>The Java platform includes built-in providers for many of the most commonly used
cryptographic algorithms, including the RSA, DSA, and ECDSA signature
algorithms, the AES encryption algorithm, the SHA-2 message digest algorithms,
and the Diffie-Hellman (DH) and Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key
agreement algorithms. Most of the built-in providers implement cryptographic
algorithms in Java code.</p>

<p>The Java platform also includes a built-in provider that acts as
a bridge to a native PKCS#11 (v2.x) token. This provider, named
<code>SunPKCS11</code>, allows Java applications to seamlessly
access cryptographic services located on PKCS#11-compliant
tokens.</p>
<p>On Windows, the Java platform includes a built-in provider that
acts as a bridge to the native Microsoft CryptoAPI. This provider,
named SunMSCAPI, allows Java applications to seamlessly access
cryptographic services on Windows through the CryptoAPI.</p>
<h2>5 Public Key Infrastructure</h2>
<p>Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is a term used for a framework
that enables secure exchange of information based on public key
cryptography. It allows identities (of people, organizations, etc.)
to be bound to digital certificates and provides a means of
verifying the authenticity of certificates. PKI encompasses keys,
certificates, public key encryption, and trusted Certification
Authorities (CAs) who generate and digitally sign certificates.</p>
<p>The Java platform includes APIs and provider support for X.509
digital certificates and Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs), as
well as PKIX-compliant certification path building and validation.
The classes related to PKI are located in the
<code>java.security</code> and <code>java.security.cert</code>
packages.</p>
<h3>Key and Certificate Storage</h3>
<p>The Java platform provides for long-term persistent storage of
cryptographic keys and certificates via key and certificate stores.
Specifically, the <code>java.security.KeyStore</code> class
represents a <i>key store</i>, a secure repository of cryptographic
keys and/or trusted certificates (to be used, for example, during
certification path validation), and the
<code>java.security.cert.CertStore</code> class represents a
<i>certificate store</i>, a public and potentially vast repository
of unrelated and typically untrusted certificates. A
<code>CertStore</code> may also store CRLs.</p>
<p><code>KeyStore</code> and <code>CertStore</code> implementations
are distinguished by types. The Java platform includes the standard
<i>PKCS11</i> and <i>PKCS12</i> key store types (whose
implementations are compliant with the corresponding PKCS
specifications from RSA Security). It also contains a proprietary
file-based key store type called <i>JKS</i> (which stands for "Java
Key Store"), and a type called DKS ("Domain Key Store") which is a
collection of keystores that are presented as a single logical
keystore.</p>
<p>The Java platform includes a special built-in JKS key store,
<i>cacerts</i>, that contains a number of certificates for
well-known, trusted CAs. The keytool utility is able to list the
certificates included in <i>cacerts</i> (see the security features
documentation link in Section 10).</p>
<p>The SunPKCS11 provider mentioned in the "Cryptography" section
(Section 4) includes a <i>PKCS11</i> <code>KeyStore</code>
implementation. This means that keys and certificates residing in
secure hardware (such as a smartcard) can be accessed and used by
Java applications via the <code>KeyStore</code> API. Note that
smartcard keys may not be permitted to leave the device. In such
cases, the <code>java.security.Key</code> object reference returned
by the <code>KeyStore</code> API may simply be a reference to the
key (that is, it would not contain the actual key material). Such a
<code>Key</code> object can only be used to perform cryptographic
operations on the device where the actual key resides.</p>
<p>The Java platform also includes an <i>LDAP</i> certificate store
type (for accessing certificates stored in an LDAP directory), as
well as an in-memory <i>Collection</i> certificate store type (for
accessing certificates managed in a
<code>java.util.Collection</code> object).</p>
<h3>PKI Tools</h3>
<p>There are two built-in tools for working with keys,
certificates, and key stores:</p>
<p><b>keytool</b> is used to create and manage key stores. It
can</p>
<ul>
<li>Create public/private key pairs</li>
<li>Display, import, and export X.509 v1, v2, and v3 certificates
stored as files</li>
<li>Create self-signed certificates</li>
<li>Issue certificate (PKCS#10) requests to be sent to CAs</li>
<li>Create certificates based on certificate requests</li>
<li>Import certificate replies (obtained from the CAs sent
certificate requests)</li>
<li>Designate public key certificates as trusted</li>
<li>Accept a password and store it securely as a secret key</li>
</ul>
<p>The <b>jarsigner</b> tool is used to sign JAR files, or to
verify signatures on signed JAR files. The Java ARchive (JAR) file
format enables the bundling of multiple files into a single file.
Typically a JAR file contains the class files and auxiliary
resources associated with applets and applications. When you want
to digitally sign code, you first use keytool to generate or import
appropriate keys and certificates into your key store (if they are
not there already), then use the <b>jar</b> tool to place the code
in a JAR file, and finally use the jarsigner tool to sign the JAR
file. The jarsigner tool accesses a key store to find any keys and
certificates needed to sign a JAR file or to verify the signature
of a signed JAR file. Note: <b>jarsigner</b> can optionally
generate signatures that include a timestamp. Systems (such as Java
Plug-in) that verify JAR file signatures can check the timestamp
and accept a JAR file that was signed while the signing certificate
was valid rather than requiring the certificate to be current.
(Certificates typically expire annually, and it is not reasonable
to expect JAR file creators to re-sign deployed JAR files
annually.)</p>
<h2>6 Authentication</h2>
<p>Authentication is the process of determining the identity of a
user. In the context of the Java runtime environment, it is the
process of identifying the user of an executing Java program. In
certain cases, this process may rely on the services described in
the "Cryptography" section (Section 4).</p>
<p>The Java platform provides APIs that enable an application to
perform user authentication via pluggable login modules.
Applications call into the <code>LoginContext</code> class (in the
<code>javax.security.auth.login</code> package), which in turn
references a configuration. The configuration specifies which login
module (an implementation of the
<code>javax.security.auth.spi.LoginModule</code> interface) is to
be used to perform the actual authentication.</p>
<p>Since applications solely talk to the standard
<code>LoginContext</code> API, they can remain independent from the
underlying plug-in modules. New or updated modules can be plugged
in for an application without having to modify the application
itself. Figure 3 illustrates the independence between applications
and underlying login modules:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/3.jpg" alt=
"diagram illustrating the independence between applications and login modules" /></p>
<p class="caption" align="center">Figure 3 Authentication login
modules plugging into the authentication framework</p>
<p>It is important to note that although login modules are
pluggable components that can be configured into the Java platform,
they are not plugged in via security Providers. Therefore, they do
not follow the Provider searching model described in Section 3.
Instead, as is shown in the above diagram, login modules are
administered by their own unique configuration.</p>
<p>The Java platform provides the following built-in LoginModules,
all in the <code>com.sun.security.auth.module</code> package:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Krb5LoginModule</code> for authentication using Kerberos
protocols</li>
<li><code>JndiLoginModule</code> for user name/password
authentication using LDAP or NIS databases</li>
<li><code>KeyStoreLoginModule</code> for logging into any type of
key store, including a PKCS#11 token key store</li>
</ul>
<p>Authentication can also be achieved during the process of
establishing a secure communication channel between two peers. The
Java platform provides implementations of a number of standard
communication protocols, which are discussed in the following
section.</p>
<h2>7 Secure Communication</h2>
<p>The data that travels across a network can be accessed by
someone who is not the intended recipient. When the data includes
private information, such as passwords and credit card numbers,
steps must be taken to make the data unintelligible to unauthorized
parties. It is also important to ensure that you are sending the
data to the appropriate party, and that the data has not been
modified, either intentionally or unintentionally, during
transport.</p>
<p>Cryptography forms the basis required for secure communication,
and that is described in Section 4. The Java platform also provides
API support and provider implementations for a number of standard
secure communication protocols.</p>
<h3>SSL/TLS</h3>
<p>The Java platform provides APIs and an implementation of the SSL
and TLS protocols that includes functionality for data encryption,
message integrity, server authentication, and optional client
authentication. Applications can use SSL/TLS to provide for the
secure passage of data between two peers over any application
protocol, such as HTTP on top of TCP/IP.</p>
<p>The <code>javax.net.ssl.SSLSocket</code> class represents a
network socket that encapsulates SSL/TLS support on top of a normal
stream socket (<code>java.net.Socket</code>). Some applications
might want to use alternate data transport abstractions (e.g.,
New-I/O); the <code>javax.net.ssl.SSLEngine</code> class is
available to produce and consume SSL/TLS packets.</p>
<p>The Java platform also includes APIs that support the notion of
pluggable (provider-based) key managers and trust managers. <i>A
key manager</i> is encapsulated by the
<code>javax.net.ssl.KeyManager</code> class, and manages the keys
used to perform authentication. A <i>trust manager</i> is
encapsulated by the <code>TrustManager</code> class (in the same
package), and makes decisions about who to trust based on
certificates in the key store it manages.</p>
<p>The Java platform includes a built-in provider that implements
the SSL/TLS protocols:</p>
<ul>
<li>SSLv3</li>
<li>TLSv1</li>
<li>TLSv1.1</li>
<li>TLSv1.2</li>
</ul>
<h3>SASL</h3>
<p>Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) is an Internet
standard that specifies a protocol for authentication and optional
establishment of a security layer between client and server
applications. SASL defines how authentication data is to be
exchanged, but does not itself specify the contents of that data.
It is a framework into which specific authentication mechanisms
that specify the contents and semantics of the authentication data
can fit. There are a number of standard SASL mechanisms defined by
the Internet community for various security levels and deployment
scenarios.</p>
<p>The Java SASL API defines classes and interfaces for
applications that use SASL mechanisms. It is defined to be
mechanism-neutral; an application that uses the API need not be
hardwired into using any particular SASL mechanism. Applications
can select the mechanism to use based on desired security features.
The API supports both client and server applications. The
<code>javax.security.sasl.Sasl</code> class is used to create
<code>SaslClient</code> and <code>SaslServer</code> objects.</p>
<p>SASL mechanism implementations are supplied in provider
packages. Each provider may support one or more SASL mechanisms and
is registered and invoked via the standard provider
architecture.</p>
<p>The Java platform includes a built-in provider that implements
the following SASL mechanisms:</p>
<ul>
<li>CRAM-MD5, DIGEST-MD5, EXTERNAL, GSSAPI, NTLM, and PLAIN client
mechanisms</li>
<li>CRAM-MD5, DIGEST-MD5, GSSAPI, and NTLM server mechanisms</li>
</ul>
<h3>GSS-API and Kerberos</h3>
<p>The Java platform contains an API with the Java language
bindings for the Generic Security Service Application Programming
Interface (GSS-API). GSS-API offers application programmers uniform
access to security services atop a variety of underlying security
mechanisms. The Java GSS-API currently requires use of a Kerberos
v5 mechanism, and the Java platform includes a built-in
implementation of this mechanism. At this time, it is not possible
to plug in additional mechanisms. Note: The
<code>Krb5LoginModule</code> mentioned in Section 6 can be used in
conjunction with the GSS Kerberos mechanism.</p>
<p>The Java platform also includes a built-in implementation of the
Simple and Protected GSSAPI Negotiation Mechanism (SPNEGO) GSS-API
mechanism.</p>
<p>Before two applications can use the Java GSS-API to securely
exchange messages between them, they must establish a joint
security context. The context encapsulates shared state information
that might include, for example, cryptographic keys. Both
applications create and use an
<code>org.ietf.jgss.GSSContext</code> object to establish and
maintain the shared information that makes up the security context.
Once a security context has been established, it can be used to
prepare secure messages for exchange.</p>
<p>The Java GSS APIs are in the <code>org.ietf.jgss</code> package.
The Java platform also defines basic Kerberos classes, like
<code>KerberosPrincipal</code>, <code>KerberosTicket</code>,
<code>KerberosKey</code>, and <code>KeyTab</code>, which are
located in the <code>javax.security.auth.kerberos</code>
package.</p>
<h2>8 Access Control</h2>
<p>The access control architecture in the Java platform protects
access to sensitive resources (for example, local files) or
sensitive application code (for example, methods in a class). All
access control decisions are mediated by a security manager,
represented by the <code>java.lang.SecurityManager</code> class. A
<code>SecurityManager</code> must be installed into the Java
runtime in order to activate the access control checks.</p>
<p>Java applets and Java&trade; Web Start applications are
automatically run with a <code>SecurityManager</code> installed.
However, local applications executed via the <b>java</b> command
are by default not run with a <code>SecurityManager</code>
installed. In order to run local applications with a
SecurityManager, either the application itself must
programmatically set one via the <code>setSecurityManager</code>
method (in the <code>java.lang.System</code> class), or <b>java</b>
must be invoked with a <code>-Djava.security.manager</code>
argument on the command line.</p>
<h3>Permissions</h3>
<p>When Java code is loaded by a class loader into the Java
runtime, the class loader automatically associates the following
information with that code:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where the code was loaded from</li>
<li>Who signed the code (if anyone)</li>
<li>Default permissions granted to the code</li>
</ul>
<p>This information is associated with the code regardless of
whether the code is downloaded over an untrusted network (e.g., an
applet) or loaded from the file system (e.g., a local application).
The location from which the code was loaded is represented by a
URL, the code signer is represented by the signer's certificate
chain, and default permissions are represented by
<code>java.security.Permission</code> objects.</p>
<p>The default permissions automatically granted to downloaded code
include the ability to make network connections back to the host
from which it originated. The default permissions automatically
granted to code loaded from the local file system include the
ability to read files from the directory it came from, and also
from subdirectories of that directory.</p>
<p>Note that the identity of the user executing the code is not
available at class loading time. It is the responsibility of
application code to authenticate the end user if necessary (for
example, as described in Section 6). Once the user has been
authenticated, the application can dynamically associate that user
with executing code by invoking the <code>doAs</code> method in the
<code>javax.security.auth.Subject</code> class.</p>
<h3>Policy</h3>
<p>As mentioned earlier, a limited set of default permissions are
granted to code by class loaders. Administrators have the ability
to flexibly manage additional code permissions via a security
policy.</p>
<p>The Java platform encapsulates the notion of a security policy
in the <code>java.security.Policy</code> class. There is only one
<code>Policy</code> object installed into the Java runtime at any
given time. The basic responsibility of the <code>Policy</code>
object is to determine whether access to a protected resource is
permitted to code (characterized by where it was loaded from, who
signed it, and who is executing it). How a <code>Policy</code>
object makes this determination is implementation-dependent. For
example, it may consult a database containing authorization data,
or it may contact another service.</p>
<p>The Java platform includes a default <code>Policy</code>
implementation that reads its authorization data from one or more
ASCII (UTF-8) files configured in the security properties file.
These policy files contain the exact sets of permissions granted to
code: specifically, the exact sets of permissions granted to code
loaded from particular locations, signed by particular entities,
and executing as particular users. The policy entries in each file
must conform to a documented proprietary syntax, and may be
composed via a simple text editor or the graphical
<b>policytool</b> utility.</p>
<h3>Access Control Enforcement</h3>
<p>The Java runtime keeps track of the sequence of Java calls that
are made as a program executes. When access to a protected resource
is requested, the entire call stack, by default, is evaluated to
determine whether the requested access is permitted.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, resources are protected by the
<code>SecurityManager</code>. Security-sensitive code in the Java
platform and in applications protects access to resources via code
like the following:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
SecurityManager sm = System.getSecurityManager();
if (sm != null) {
   sm.checkPermission(perm);
}
</pre>
<p>where perm is the Permission object that corresponds to the
requested access. For example, if an attempt is made to read the
file <i>/tmp/abc</i>, the permission may be constructed as
follows:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
Permission perm = 
    new java.io.FilePermission("/tmp/abc", "read");
</pre>
<p>The default implementation of <code>SecurityManager</code>
delegates its decision to the
<code>java.security.AccessController</code> implementation. The
<code>AccessController</code> traverses the call stack, passing to
the installed security <code>Policy</code> each code element in the
stack, along with the requested permission (for example, the
<code>FilePermission</code> in the above example). The
<code>Policy</code> determines whether the requested access is
granted, based on the permissions configured by the administrator.
If access is not granted, the <code>AccessController</code> throws
a <code>java.lang.SecurityException.</code></p>
<p>Figure 4 illustrates access control enforcement. In this
particular example, there are initially two elements on the call
stack, ClassA and ClassB. ClassA invokes a method in ClassB, which
then attempts to access the file <i>/tmp/abc</i> by creating an
instance of <code>java.io.FileInputStream.</code> The
<code>FileInputStream</code> constructor creates a
<code>FilePermission</code>, <code>perm</code>, as shown above, and
then passes <code>perm</code> to the <code>SecurityManager</code>'s
<code>checkPermission</code> method. In this particular case, only
the permissions for ClassA and ClassB need to be checked, because
all system code, including <code>FileInputStream</code>,
<code>SecurityManager</code>, and <code>AccessController</code>,
automatically receives all permissions.</p>
<p>In this example, ClassA and ClassB have different code
characteristics &ndash; they come from different locations and have
different signers. Each may have been granted a different set of
permissions. The <code>AccessController</code> only grants access
to the requested file if the <code>Policy</code> indicates that
both classes have been granted the required
<code>FilePermission</code>.</p>

<p class="caption" align="center">Figure 4 Controlling access to
resources</p>
<h2>9 XML Signature</h2>
<p>The Java XML Digital Signature API is a standard Java API for
generating and validating XML Signatures.</p>
<p>XML Signatures can be applied to data of any type, XML or binary
(see <a href=
"http://www.w3.org/TR/xmldsig-core/">http://www.w3.org/TR/xmldsig-core/</a>).
The resulting signature is represented in XML. An XML Signature can
be used to secure your data and provide data integrity, message
authentication, and signer authentication.</p>
<p>The API is designed to support all of the required or
recommended features of the W3C Recommendation for XML-Signature
Syntax and Processing. The API is extensible and pluggable and is
based on the Java Cryptography Service Provider Architecture.</p>
<p>The Java XML Digital Signature APIs consist of six packages:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>javax.xml.crypto</code></li>
<li><code>javax.xml.crypto.dsig</code></li>
<li><code>javax.xml.crypto.dsig.keyinfo</code></li>
<li><code>javax.xml.crypto.dsig.spec</code></li>
<li><code>javax.xml.crypto.dom</code></li>
<li><code>javax.xml.crypto.dsig.dom</code></li>
</ul>

<p><b>Note</b>: Historically, as new types of security services
were added to the Java platform (sometimes initially as
extensions), various acronyms were used to refer to them. Since
these acronyms are still in use in the Java security documentation,
here is an explanation of what they represent: JSSE (Java&trade;
Secure Socket Extension) refers to the SSL-related services
described in Section 7, JCE (Java&trade; Cryptography Extension)
refers to cryptographic services (Section 4), and JAAS (Java&trade;
Authentication and Authorization Service) refers to the
authentication and user-based access control services described in
Sections 6 and 8, respectively.</p>
