<!--*******ORBS AND INVOCATIONS********-->
<i><a name="orbsandinvocations" id="orbsandinvocations"></a></i>
<h2><i>ORBs and Invocations</i></h2>
<p><i>For a client to invoke a CORBA object operation, both the
client and the server (the object implementation) must use a CORBA
software component called an ORB (object request broker). ORBs are
the common denominators that bridge the differences in location,
platform, and programming language that can separate a client and a
server. ORBs can contact each other across the network, can create
and interpret object references (CORBA object handles), and can
marshal parameters into and out of the format used by IIOP. In
addition to enabling client/server communication, ORBs provide
other services, but they are not described here.</i></p>
<p><i>The two ways to invoke an operation on a CORBA object
are:</i></p>
<ul>
<li><i><a href="#staticinvoke">Static invocation</a>, which is used
most often and most resembles conventional Java programming, is
type-checked by the compiler. But it can only be used for objects
whose interface definitions exist when the invoking client is
compiled.</i></li>
<li><i><a href="#DynamicInvocation">Dynamic invocation</a></i> is
more flexible because clients can invoke objects they discover at
runtime. However, compile-time type-checking is impossible with
dynamic invocation. Although it's possible to type-check parameters
at runtime, doing so requires a CORBA Interface Repository, which
the current release of Java&nbsp;IDL does not provide.</li>
</ul>
<!--*******STATIC INVOCATION********-->
<h2><a name="staticinvoke" id="staticinvoke">Static
Invocation</a></h2>
<p>To make a static invocation on a CORBA object, a Java client
needs an object reference to the servant that performs the
operation. The object reference has two important functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>It uniquely identifies the servant, wherever it is
located.</li>
<li>It implements the client stub interface, making the reference a
local proxy for the servant object.</li>
</ul>
Clients don't create object references but obtain them, typically
from other objects such as factories or <a href=
"jidlNaming.html">naming</a> contexts.
<p>OMG IDL is the language in which CORBA object interfaces are
defined. For each OMG IDL module, the <tt>idlj</tt> compiler
generates a Java package. For each interface <code>Foo</code>
defined in an OMG IDL module, the generated package contains the
following items of interest to the client programmer:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Java <em>signature</em> interface <code>Foo</code>, which
extends <tt>org.omg.portable.IDLEntity</tt>,
<tt>org.omg.CORBA.Object</tt>, and the operations interface. The
signature interface is used as the signature type in method
declarations when interfaces of the specified type are used in
other interfaces. From the client's point of view, an object
reference for a CORBA <code>Foo</code> object implements this
interface.
<p>Note: The Stub implements the <code>Foo</code> interface, where
it generates code for each method to marshall the arguments, invoke
the method, and then unmarshall the arguments.</p>
</li>
<li>A Java <em>operations</em> interface
<code>FooOperations</code>, which is used in the server-side
mapping and as a mechanism for providing optimized calls for
co-located clients and server. The server developer provides
implementation for the methods indicated by the operations
interface.
<p>Note: The server writer usually extends <code>FooPOA</code> and
provides implementation for the methods provided by the operations
interface.</p>
</li>
<li>A Java class <code>FooHelper</code>, that defines auxiliary
methods, notably <code>narrow()</code>, which is the CORBA
counterpart of Java casting.</li>
<li>A Java class called <tt>FooHolder</tt>, that holds a public
<tt>Foo</tt> member. Holders are required for CORBA operations that
take <tt>out</tt> or <tt>inout</tt> arguments, which, unlike CORBA
<tt>in</tt> arguments, don't map directly to Java's pass-by-value
semantics.</li>
</ul>
<!--*******DYNAMIC INVOCATION********-->
<h2><a name="DynamicInvocation" id="DynamicInvocation">Dynamic
Invocation</a></h2>
<p>CORBA dynamic invocation uses an object called a <i>request</i>
to hold everything pertinent to an invocation: the object
reference, the name of the operation, its parameters, and space for
the result. The client builds a request object describing an
operation, then calls the request's <code>invoke</code> method,
which dispatches the request just as a stub would. When the invoke
method returns, the result is available in the request object.</p>
<p>The key to dynamic invocation is the ability of requests to hold
self-describing data. This facility enables a request object to
represent any invocation of any operation, regardless of its
parameters. Each self-describing data element has a special type
known in OMG IDL as <code>Any</code>. An <code>Any</code> consists
of a typecode (whose values are defined by OMG IDL) and a value;
the typecode specifies the type of the value.</p>
