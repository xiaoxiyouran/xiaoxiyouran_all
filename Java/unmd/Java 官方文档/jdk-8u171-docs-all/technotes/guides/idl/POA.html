<h1>Portable Object Adapter (POA)</h1>
<h2>What is the Portable Object Adapter (POA)?</h2>
<p>An <em>object adapter</em> is the mechanism that connects a
request using an object reference with the proper code to service
that request. The Portable Object Adapter, or POA, is a particular
type of object adapter that is defined by the CORBA specification.
The POA is designed to meet the following goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allow programmers to construct object implementations that are
portable between different ORB products.</li>
<li>Provide support for objects with persistent identities.</li>
<li>Provide support for transparent activation of objects.</li>
<li>Allow a single <a href="jidlGlossary.html#servant">servant</a>
to support multiple object identities simultaneously.</li>
</ul>
<p>This document presents an introduction to using the POA with the
Java SE. For a more complete description
of the POA, see Chapter 11 of the <em><a href=
"http://www.omg.org/cgi-bin/doc?formal/99-10-07">CORBA 2.3.1
Specification</a></em>. 
<!--  ********** Using the POA  ***************-->
<a name="using" id="using"></a></p>
<h2>Creating and Using the POA</h2>
<p>The steps for creating and using a POA will vary according to
the specific application being developed. The following steps
generally occur during the POA life cycle:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="#create">Get the root POA</a></li>
<li><a href="#policy">Define the POA's policies</a></li>
<li><a href="#createpoa">Create the POA</a></li>
<li><a href="#poamanager">Activate the POAManager</a></li>
<li><a href="#servant">Activate the servants</a>, which may include
activating the Tie</li>
<li><a href="#objref">Create the object reference from the
POA</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Each step is described in more detail in the sections that
follow. <!--  **********  Get THE ROOT POA ***************-->
<a name="create" id="create"></a></p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Get the root POA</strong></p>
<p>The first step is to get the first POA, which is called the
<em>rootPOA</em>. The root POA is managed by the ORB and provided
to the application using the ORB initialization interface under the
initial object name "RootPOA".</p>
<p>An example of code that will get the root POA object and cast it
to a POA is:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
      ORB orb = ORB.init( args, null );
      POA rootPOA = POAHelper.narrow(orb.resolve_initial_references("RootPOA"));
</pre>
<!--  ********** Define the POA's Policies ***************-->
<a name="policy" id="policy"></a><strong>Step 2: Define the POA's
Policies</strong>
<p>The Portable Object Adapter (POA) is designed to provide an
object adapter that can be used with multiple ORB implementations
with no rewriting needed to deal with different vendors'
implementations.</p>
<p>The POA is also intended to allow persistent objects -- at
least, from the client's perspective. That is, as far as the client
is concerned, these objects are always alive, and maintain data
values stored in them, even though physically, the server may have
been restarted many times.</p>
<p>The POA allows the object implementer a lot more control over
the object's identity, state, storage, and life cycle. You can
create a POA without defining any policies and the default values
will be used. The root POA has the following policies by
default:</p>
<ul>
<li>Thread Policy: ORB_CTRL_MODEL</li>
<li>Lifespan Policy: TRANSIENT</li>
<li>Object Id Uniqueness Policy: UNIQUE_ID</li>
<li>Id Assignment Policy: SYSTEM_ID</li>
<li>Servant Retention Policy: RETAIN</li>
<li>Request Processing Policy: USE_ACTIVE_OBJECT_MAP_ONLY</li>
<li>Implicit Activation Policy: IMPLICIT_ACTIVATION</li>
</ul>
<p>The following code snippet shows how policies are set in the
<a href="../rmi-iiop/rmiiiopexample.html#server">RMI-IIOP (with
POA)</a> example:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
      Policy[] tpolicy = new Policy[3];
      tpolicy[0] = rootPOA.create_lifespan_policy(
        LifespanPolicyValue.TRANSIENT );
      tpolicy[1] = rootPOA.create_request_processing_policy(
        RequestProcessingPolicyValue.USE_ACTIVE_OBJECT_MAP_ONLY );
      tpolicy[2] = rootPOA.create_servant_retention_policy(
        ServantRetentionPolicyValue.RETAIN);
</pre>
<p>Each policy is discussed briefly in the following topics. For
more information on POA policies, refer to Chapter 11, <em>Portable
Object Adapter</em> of the <a href=
"http://www.omg.org/cgi-bin/doc?formal/99-10-07">CORBA/IIOP 2.3.1
Specification</a>. 
<!--  ********** Thread Policy ***************-->
<a name="thread" id="thread"></a></p>
<h3>Thread Policy</h3>
<p>This policy specifies the threading model used with the created
POA. The default is <code>ORB_CTRL_MODEL</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>ThreadPolicyValue</code> can have the following
values:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ORB_CTRL_MODEL</code> - The ORB is responsible for
assigning requests for an ORB-controlled POA to threads.</li>
<li><code>SINGLE_THREAD_MODEL</code> - Requests for a
single-threaded POA are processed sequentially.
(<strong>NOTE:</strong> This policy is not supported in the ORB
shipped with Java SE).</li>
</ul>
<!--  ********** Lifespan Policy ***************-->
<a name="lifespan" id="lifespan"></a>
<h3>Lifespan Policy</h3>
<p>This policy specifies the lifespan of the objects implemented in
the created POA. The default is <code>TRANSIENT</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>LifespanPolicyValue</code> can have the following
values:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>TRANSIENT</code> - The objects implemented in the POA
cannot outlive the POA instance in which they are first
created.</li>
<li><code>PERSISTENT</code> - The objects implemented in the POA
can outlive the process in which they are first created.</li>
</ul>
<!--  ********** Object Id Uniqueness Policy ***************-->
<a name="oi" id="oi"></a>
<h3>Object Id Uniqueness Policy</h3>
<p>This policy specifies whether the servants activated in the
created POA must have unique object identities. The default is
<code>UNIQUE_ID</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>IdUniquenessPolicyValue</code> can have the following
values:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>UNIQUE_ID</code> - Servants activated with that POA
support exactly one Object Id.</li>
<li><code>MULTIPLE_ID</code> - A servant activated with that POA
may support one or more Object Ids.</li>
</ul>
<!--  ********** Id Assignment Policy ***************-->
<a name="iap" id="iap"></a>
<h3>Id Assignment Policy</h3>
<p>This policy specifies whether Object Ids in the created POA are
generated by the application or by the ORB. The default is
<code>SYSTEM_ID</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>IdAssignmentPolicyValue</code> can have the following
values:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>USER_ID</code> - Objects created with that POA are
assigned Object Ids only by the application.</li>
<li><code>SYSTEM_ID</code> - Objects created with that POA are
assigned a unique object id by the POA. If the POA also has the
<code>PERSISTENT</code> policy, assigned Object Ids must be unique
across all instantiations of the same POA.</li>
</ul>
<!--  ********** Servant Retention Policy ***************-->
<a name="sr" id="sr"></a>
<h3>Servant Retention Policy</h3>
<p>This policy specifies whether the created POA retains active
servants in an Active Object Map. The default is
<code>RETAIN</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>ServantRetentionPolicyValue</code> can have the
following values.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>RETAIN</code> - to indicate that the POA will retain
active servants in its Active Object Map.</li>
<li><code>NON_RETAIN</code> - to indicate Servants are not retained
by the POA.</li>
</ul>
<!--  ********** Request Processing Policy ***************-->
<a name="rp" id="rp"></a>
<h3>Request Processing Policy</h3>
<p>This policy specifies how requests are processed by the created
POA. The default is <code>USE_ACTIVE_OBJECT_MAP_ONLY</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>RequestProcessingPolicyValue</code> can have the
following values:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>USE_ACTIVE_OBJECT_MAP_ONLY</code> - If the object ID is
not found in the Active Object Map, an
<code>OBJECT_NOT_EXIST</code> exception is returned to the client.
The <code>RETAIN</code> policy is also required.</li>
<li><code>USE_DEFAULT_SERVANT</code> - If the object ID is not
found in the Active Object Map or the <code>NON_RETAIN</code>
policy is present, and a default servant has been registered with
the POA using the <code>set_servant</code> operation, the request
is dispatched to the default servant.</li>
<li><code>USE_SERVANT_MANAGER</code> - If the object ID is not
found in the Active Object Map or the <code>NON_RETAIN</code>
policy is present, and a servant manager has been registered with
the POA using the <code>set_servant_manager</code> operation, the
servant manager is given the opportunity to locate or activate a
servant or raise an exception.</li>
</ul>
<!--  **********Implicit ActivationPolicy ***************-->
<a name="ia" id="ia"></a>
<h3>Implicit Activation Policy</h3>
<p>This policy specifies whether implicit activation of servants is
supported in the created POA. The default value is
<code>IMPLICIT_ACTIVATION</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>ImplicitActivationPolicyValue</code> can have the
following values:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>IMPLICIT_ACTIVATION</code> - Indicates implicit
activation of servants. This requires <code>SYSTEM_ID</code> and
<code>RETAIN</code> policies to be set.</li>
<li><code>NO_IMPLICIT_ACTIVATION</code> - Indicates no implicit
servant activation.</li>
</ul>
<!--  ********** CREATE THE POA  ***************-->
<a name="createpoa" id="createpoa"></a><strong>Step 3: Create the
POA</strong>
<p>Creating a new POA allows the application developer to declare
specific policy choices for the new POA and to provide a different
<a href="#adapteractivator">adapter activator</a> and <a href=
"#servantmanager">servant manager</a> (these are callback objects
used by the POA to activate POAs on demand and activate servants).
Creating new POAs also allows the application developer to
partition the name space of objects, as Object Ids are interpreted
relative to a POA. Finally, by creating new POAs, the developer can
independently control request processing for multiple sets of
objects.</p>
<p>A POA is created as a child of an existing POA using the
<tt>create_POA</tt> operation on the parent POA. To create a new
POA, pass in the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Name of the POA. The POA is given a name that must be unique
with respect to all other POAs with the same parent. In the
following example, the POA is named <code>childPOA</code>.</li>
<li>POA Manager. Specify the POA Manager to be associated with the
new POA. If, as is shown in the following example, <tt>null</tt> is
passed for this parameter, a new POA Manager will be created. The
user can also choose to pass the POA Manager of another POA.</li>
<li>Policy List. Specify the policy list to be associated with the
POA to control its behavior. In the following example, a persistent
lifespan policy has already been defined for this POA.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following code snippet shows how the POA is created in the
<a href="jidlExample2.html#server">Hello World: Persistent
Server</a> example.</p>
<div style="margin-left: 2em">
<pre class="codeblock">
// Create a POA by passing the Persistent Policy
POA persistentPOA = rootPOA.create_POA("childPOA", null, 
   persistentPolicy ); 
</pre></div>
<!--  ********** POA MANAGER ***************-->
<a name="poamanager" id="poamanager"></a><strong>Step 4: Activate
the POAManager</strong>
<p>Each POA object has an associated <code>POAManager</code> object
that controls the processing state of the POAs with which it is
associated, such as whether requests to the POA are queued or
discarded. The <code>POAManager</code> can also deactivate the POA.
A POA Manager may be associated with one or more POA objects.</p>
<p>The <code>POAManager</code> can have the following states:</p>
<ul>
<li>Holding - In this state, associated POAs will queue incoming
requests.</li>
<li>Active - In this state, associated POAs will start processing
requests.</li>
<li>Discarding - In this state, associated POAs will discard
incoming requests.</li>
<li>Inactive - In this state, associated POAs will reject the
requests that have not begun executing as well as any new
requests.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href=
"../../../api/org/omg/PortableServer/POAManagerOperations.html"><code>
POAManagerOperations</code></a> javadocs contain more information
on these states.</p>
<p>POA Managers are not automatically activated when they are
created. The following code snippet shows how the
<tt>POAManager</tt> is activated in the <a href=
"jidlExample2.html#server">Hello World: Persistent Server</a>
example. If the POA Manager is not activated in this way, all calls
to the <code>Servant</code> will hang because, by default, the POA
Manager is in the <code>HOLD</code> state.</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
            // Activate PersistentPOA's POAManager. Without this step,
            // all calls to Persistent Server will hang because POAManager
            // will be in the 'HOLD' state.
            persistentPOA.the_POAManager().activate( );
</pre>
<p><!--  ********** SERVANTS ***************-->
<a name="servant" id="servant"></a><strong>Step 5: Activate the
servants</strong></p>
<p>The following information is quoted from section 11.2.5 of the
<em>CORBA Specification</em>.</p>
At any point in time, a CORBA object may or may not be associated
with an active servant.
<p>If the POA has the <code>RETAIN</code> policy, the servant and
its associated Object Id are entered into the Active Object Map of
the appropriate POA. This type of activation can be accomplished in
one of the following ways.</p>
<ul>
<li>The server application itself explicitly activates individual
objects (via the <code>activate_object</code> or
<code>activate_object_with_id</code> operations).</li>
<li>The server application instructs the POA to activate objects on
demand by having the POA invoke a user-supplied servant manager.
The server application registers this servant manager with
<code>set_servant_manager</code>.</li>
<li>Under some circumstances (when the
<code>IMPLICIT_ACTIVATION</code> policy is also in effect and the
language binding allows such an operation), the POA may implicitly
activate an object when the server application attempts to obtain a
reference for a servant that is not already active (that is, not
associated with an Object Id).</li>
</ul>
<p>If the <code>USE_DEFAULT_SERVANT</code> policy is also in
effect, the server application instructs the POA to activate
unknown objects by having the POA invoke a single servant no matter
what the Object Id is. The server application registers this
servant with <code>set_servant</code>.</p>
<p>If the POA has the <code>NON_RETAIN</code> policy, for every
request, the POA may use either a default servant or a servant
manager to locate an active servant. From the POA's point of view,
the servant is active only for the duration of that one request.
The POA does not enter the servant-object association into the
Active Object Map.</p>
<p>When using RMI-IIOP technology, your implementations use
delegation (known as the Tie model) to associate your
implementation with the interface. When you create an instance of
your implementation, you also need to create a Tie object to
associate it with a CORBA interface. The following code snippet
shows how to activate the Tie, if the POA policy is
<code>USE_ACTIVE_OBJECT_MAP_ONLY</code>. This sample code is from
the <a href="../rmi-iiop/rmiiiopexample.html#server">RMI-IIOP with
POA</a> example.</p>
<div style="margin-left: 2em">
<pre class="codeblock">
_HelloImpl_Tie tie = (_HelloImpl_Tie)Util.getTie( helloImpl );
String helloId = "hello";
byte[] id = helloId.getBytes();
tPOA.activate_object_with_id( id, tie );
</pre></div>
<p>The CORBA Specification discusses creating object references
(section 11.2.4), activating objects (section 11.2.5), and
processing requests (section 11.2.6) in more detail than is done in
this document. Please refer to the <em><a href=
"http://www.omg.org/cgi-bin/doc?formal/99-10-07">CORBA 2.3.1
Specification</a></em> for more information.</p>
<!--  **********  OBJECT REFERENCES ***************-->
<a name="objref" id="objref"></a><strong>Step 6: Create the object
reference</strong>
<p>Object references are created in servers. Once created, they may
be exported to clients. Object references encapsulate object
identity information and information required by the ORB to
identify and locate the server and the POA with which the object is
associated. References are created in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Explicitly activate a servant and associate it with an object
reference.
<p>The following example is from <a href=
"jidlExample2.html#server">Hello World: Persistent Server</a>. This
example uses the <code>servant_to_reference</code> operation to map
an activated servant to its corresponding object reference.</p>
<div style="margin-left: 2em">
<pre class="codeblock">
// Resolve Root Naming context and bind a name for the
// servant.
org.omg.CORBA.Object obj = orb.resolve_initial_references(
  "NameService" );
NamingContextExt rootContext = NamingContextExtHelper.narrow( obj );

NameComponent[] nc = rootContext.to_name( 
  "PersistentServerTutorial" );
rootContext.rebind( nc, persistentPOA.<strong>servant_to_reference</strong>( 
  servant ) );
</pre></div>
</li>
<li>Server application directly creates a reference.
<p>The following example is from the <a href=
"../rmi-iiop/rmiiiopexample.html#server">RMI-IIOP with POA</a>
example. In this example, the following code directly creates a
reference. In doing so, they bring the abstract object into
existence, but do not associate it with an active servant.</p>
<div style="margin-left: 2em">
<pre class="codeblock">
// Publish the object reference using the same object id
// used to activate the Tie object.
Context initialNamingContext = new InitialContext();
initialNamingContext.rebind("HelloService", 
tPOA.<strong>create_reference_with_id</strong>(id, 
  tie._all_interfaces(tPOA,id)[0]) );
</pre></div>
</li>
<li>Server application causes a servant to implicitly activate
itself.
<p>The behavior can occur only if the POA has been created with the
<code>IMPLICIT_ACTIVATION</code> policy, which is the default
behavior.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Once an reference is created in the server, it can be made
available to clients. For more information on creating object
references and exporting to clients, refer to section 11.2.4 of the
<em><a href="http://www.omg.org/cgi-bin/doc?formal/99-10-07">CORBA
2.3.1 Specification</a></em> for more information.</p>
<!--  ********** ADAPTER ACTIVATORS ***************-->
<a name="adapteractivator" id="adapteractivator"></a>
<h2>Adapter Activators</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>For an example application that uses Adapter
Activators, see <a href="adapteractivator.html"><em>Using Adapter
Activators</em></a>.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>An <strong>adapter activator</strong> is optional. You would use
an adapter activator if POAs need to be created during request
processing. If all needed POAs are created when the application is
executed, an adapter activator is not required.</p>
<p>An adapter activator supplies a POA with the ability to create
child POAs on demand, as a side-effect of receiving a request that
names the child POA (or one of its children), or when the
<code>find_POA</code> method is called with an activate parameter
value of TRUE. The ORB will invoke an operation on an adapter
activator when a request is received for a child POA that does not
currently exist. The adapter activator can then create the required
POA on demand.</p>
<p>A request must be capable of conveying the Object Id of the
target object as well as the identification of the POA that created
the target object reference. When a client issues a request, the
ORB first locates an appropriate server (perhaps starting one if
needed) and then it locates the appropriate POA within that
server.</p>
<p>If the POA does not exist in the server process, the application
has the opportunity to re-create the required POA by using an
adapter activator. An adapter activator is a user-implemented
object that can be associated with a POA. It is invoked by the ORB
when a request is received for a non-existent child POA. The
adapter activator has the opportunity to create the required POA.
If it does not, the client receives the
<code>ADAPTER_NONEXISTENT</code> exception.</p>
<p>Once the ORB has located the appropriate POA, it delivers the
request to that POA. The further processing of that request depends
both upon the policies associated with that POA as well as the
object's current state of activation.</p>
<p>For more information on Adapter Activators, refer to section
11.3.3 of the <em><a href=
"http://www.omg.org/cgi-bin/doc?formal/99-10-07">CORBA 2.3.1
Specification</a></em> or the <a href=
"../../../api/org/omg/PortableServer/AdapterActivatorOperations.html">
<em>AdapterActivatorOperations API documentation</em></a>. 
<!--  ********** SERVANT MANAGERS ***************-->
<a name="servantmanager" id="servantmanager"></a></p>
<h2>Servant Managers</h2>
<p>Servant Managers are optional. You would use a servant manager
to allow the POA to activate servants on demand when a request for
an inactive object is received. If your server loads all objects
when it starts up, you do not need a servant manager.</p>
<p>A <strong>servant manager</strong> is a callback object that the
application developer can associate with a POA. The ORB will invoke
operations on servant managers to activate servants on demand, and
to deactivate servants. Servant managers are responsible for
managing the association of an object reference (as characterized
by its Object Id value) with a particular servant, and for
determining whether an object reference exists or not. Each servant
manager type contains two operations, the first called to find and
return a servant and the second to deactivate a servant. The
operations differ according to the amount of information usable for
their situation.</p>
<p>To use servant managers, the <code>USE_SERVANT_MANAGER</code>
policy must be set. Once set, the type of servant manager used in a
particular situation depends on other policies in the POA. The two
types of servant managers are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code><a href=
"../../../api/org/omg/PortableServer/ServantActivatorOperations.html">
ServantActivator</a></code>
<p>When the POA has the <code>RETAIN</code> policy, it uses servant
managers that are <code>ServantActivators</code>.</p>
<p>This type is typically used to activate persistent objects.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>For an example that uses Servant Activators, see
<a href="servantactivator.html">Using Servant
Activators</a>.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code><a href=
"../../../api/org/omg/PortableServer/ServantLocatorOperations.html">
ServantLocator</a></code>
<p>When the POA has the <code>NON_RETAIN</code> policy, it uses
servant managers that are <code>ServantLocators</code>. Because the
POA knows that the servant returned by this servant manager will be
used only for a single request, it can supply extra information to
the servant manager's operations and the servant manager's pair of
operations may be able to cooperate to do something different than
a <code>ServantActivator</code>. When the POA uses the
<code>ServantLocator</code> interface, immediately after performing
the operation invocation on the servant returned by preinvoke, the
POA will invoke postinvoke on the servant manager, passing the
ObjectId value and the Servant value as parameters (among others).
This feature may be used to force every request for objects
associated with a POA to be mediated by the servant manager.</p>
<p>This type is typically used to activate transient objects.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>For an example that uses Servant Locators see <a href=
"servantlocators.html">Using Servant Locators</a>.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information on Servant Managers, refer to section
11.3.4 of the <em><a href=
"http://www.omg.org/cgi-bin/doc?formal/99-10-07">CORBA 2.3.1
Specification</a></em>. 
<!--           **** POA Q & A *************** --></p>
<h2>POA Q&amp;A</h2>
<h3>Is <tt>POAManager.activate()</tt> required for a newly created
POA?</h3>
<p><tt>POAManager.activate()</tt> is required for a newly created
POA if a null is passed for the <tt>POAManager</tt> parameter to
<tt>POA::createPOA</tt> . If null is passed, a new
<tt>POAManager</tt> is created and associated with the created POA.
In this case, <tt>POAManager.activate()</tt> is needed.</p>
<p>To control several POAs with the same <tt>POAManager</tt>, you
would:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a POA or use the <tt>rootPOA</tt></li>
<li>Obtain the POA's manager via <tt>POA::the_POAManager</tt></li>
<li>Pass the <tt>POAManager</tt> to subsequent <tt>createPOA</tt>
