<h2>1.0 Starting out</h2>
<p>One of the most significant capabilities of the Java
platform is the ability to dynamically download Java software from
any Uniform Resource Locator (URL) to a virtual machine (VM)
running in a separate process, usually on a different physical
system. The result is that a remote system can run a program, for
example an applet, which has never been installed on its disk. For
the first few sections of this document, codebase with regard to
applets will be discussed in order to help describe codebase with
regard to Java Remote Method Invocation (Java RMI).</p>
<p>For example, a VM running from within a web browser can download
the bytecodes for subclasses of <code>java.applet.Applet</code> and
any other classes needed by that applet. The system on which the
browser is running has most likely never run this applet before,
nor installed it on its disk. Once all the necessary classes have
been downloaded from the server, the browser can start the
execution of the applet program using the local resources of the
system on which the client browser is running.</p>
<p>Java RMI takes advantage of this capability to download and
execute classes and on systems where those classes have never been
installed on disk. Using the Java RMI API any VM, not only those in
browsers, can download any Java class file including specialized
Java RMI stub classes, which enable the execution of method calls
on a remote server using the server system's resources.</p>
<p>The notion of a codebase originates from the use of <code class=
"Code">ClassLoader</code>s in the Java programming language. When a
Java program uses a <code class="Code">ClassLoader</code>, that
class loader needs to know the location(s) from which it should be
allowed to load classes. Usually, a class loader is used in
conjunction with an HTTP server that is serving up compiled classes
for the Java platform. Most likely, the first <code class=
"Code">ClassLoader</code>/codebase pairing that you came into
contact with was the <code class="Code">AppletClassLoader</code>,
and the &quot;codebase&quot; part of the <code class=
"Code">&lt;applet&gt;</code> HTML tag, so this tutorial will assume
that you have some experience with Java RMI programming, as well as
writing HTML files that contain applet tags. For example, the HTML
source will contain something like:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
&lt;applet height=100 width=100 codebase=&quot;myclasses/&quot; code=&quot;My.class&quot;&gt;
        &lt;param name=&quot;ticker&quot;&gt;
&lt;/applet&gt;
</pre>

<h2>2.0 What is a codebase?</h2>
<p>A codebase can be defined as a source, or a place, from which to
load classes into a virtual machine. For example, if you invited a
new friend over for dinner, you would need to give that friend
directions to the place where you lived, so that he or she could
locate your house. Similarly, you can think of a codebase as the
directions that you give to a VM, so it can find your [potentially
remote] classes.</p>
<p>You can think of your <code class="Code">CLASSPATH</code> as a
&quot;local codebase&quot;, because it is the list of places on
disk from which you load local classes. When loading classes from a
local disk-based source, your <code class="Code">CLASSPATH</code>
variable is consulted. Your <code class="Code">CLASSPATH</code> can
be set to take either relative or absolute path names to
directories and/or archives of class files. So just as <code class=
"Code">CLASSPATH</code> is a kind of &quot;local codebase&quot;,
the codebase used by applets and remote objects can be thought of
as a &quot;remote codebase&quot;. <a name="section3" id=
"section3"></a></p>
<h2>3.0 How does it work?</h2>
<h3>3.1 How codebase is used in applets</h3>
<p>To interact with an applet, that applet and any classes that it
needs to run must be accessible by remote clients. While applets
can be accessed from &quot;<code>ftp://</code>&quot; or local
&quot;<code>file:///</code>&quot; URLs, they are usually accessed
from a remote HTTP server.</p>
<ol>
<li>The client browser requests an applet class that is not found
in the client's <code class="Code">CLASSPATH</code></li>
<li>The class definition of the applet (and any other class(es)
that it needs) is downloaded from the server to the client using
HTTP</li>
<li>The applet executes on the client</li>
</ol>
<img src="images/codebase-1.gif" alt=
"illustrates three steps above" />
<p>Figure 1: Downloading applets</p>

<p>The applet's codebase is always relative to the URL of the HTML
page in which the <code class="Code">&lt;applet&gt;</code> tag is
contained.</p>
<h3>3.2 How codebase is used in Java RMI</h3>
<p>Using Java RMI, applications can create remote objects that
accept method calls from clients in other VMs. In order for a
client to call methods on a remote object, the client must have a
way to communicate with the remote object. Rather than having to
program the client to speak the remote object's protocol, Java RMI
uses special classes called stubs that can be downloaded to the
client that are used to communicate with (make method calls on) the
remote object. The <code>java.rmi.server.codebase</code> property
value represents one or more URL locations from which these stubs
(and any classes needed by the stubs) can be downloaded.</p>
<p>Like applets, the classes needed to execute remote method calls
can be downloaded from &quot;<code class=
"Code">file:///</code>&quot; URLs, but like applets, a
&quot;<code class="Code">file:///</code>&quot; URL generally
requires that the client and the server reside on the same physical
host, unless the file system referred to by the URL is made
available using some other protocol, such as NFS.</p>
<p>Generally, the classes needed to execute remote method calls
should be made accessible from a network resource, such as an HTTP
or FTP server.</p>
<img src="images/codebase-2.gif" alt=
"illustrates the first 5 steps of the stub downloadling process, as listed below" />
<p>Figure 2: Downloading Java RMI stubs</p>

<ol>
<li>The remote object's codebase is specified by the remote
object's server by setting the
<code>java.rmi.server.codebase</code> property. The Java RMI server
registers a remote object, bound to a name, with the Java RMI
registry. The codebase set on the server VM is annotated to the
remote object reference in the Java RMI registry.</li>
<li>The Java RMI client requests a reference to a named remote
object. The reference (the remote object's stub instance) is what
the client will use to make remote method calls to the remote
object.</li>
<li>The Java RMI registry returns a reference (the stub instance)
to the requested class. If the class definition for the stub
instance can be found locally in the client's <code class=
"Code">CLASSPATH</code> , which is always searched before the
codebase, the client will load the class locally. However, if the
definition for the stub is not found in the client's
<code>CLASSPATH</code>, the client will attempt to retrieve the
class definition from the remote object's codebase.</li>
<li>The client requests the class definition from the codebase. The
codebase the client uses is the URL that was annotated to the stub
instance when the stub class was loaded by the registry. Back in
step 1, the annotated stub for the exported object was then
registered with the Java RMI registry bound to a name.</li>
<li>The class definition for the stub (and any other class(es) that
it needs) is downloaded to the client.
<dl>
<dd><b>Note:</b> <i>Steps 4 and 5 are the sames steps that the
registry took to load the remote object class, when the remote
object was bound to a name in (registered with) the Java RMI
registry. When the registry attempted to load the remote object's
stub class, it requested the class definition from the codebase
associated with that remote object.</i></dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Now the client has all the information that it needs to invoke
remote methods on the remote object. The stub instance acts as a
proxy to the remote object that exists on the server; so unlike the
applet which uses a codebase to execute code in its local VM, the
Java RMI client uses the remote object's codebase to execute code
in another, potentially remote VM, as illustrated in Figure 3:</li>
</ol>

<h2>4.0 Using codebase in Java RMI for more than just stub
downloading</h2>
<p>In addition to downloading stubs and their associated classes to
clients, the <code class="Code">java.rmi.server.codebase</code>
property can be used to specify a location from which any class,
not only stubs, can be downloaded.</p>
<p>When a client makes a method call to a remote object, the method
that it calls could be written to accept no arguments or a number
of arguments. There are three distinct cases that may occur, based
on the data type(s) of the method argument(s).</p>
<p>In the first case, all of the method parameters (and return
value) are primitive data types, so the remote object knows how to
interpret them as method parameters, and there is no need to check
its <code class="Code">CLASSPATH</code> or any codebase.</p>
<p>In the second case, at least one remote method parameter or the
return value is an object, for which the remote object can find the
class definition locally in its <code class=
"Code">CLASSPATH</code>.</p>
<p>In the third case (shown as Step 6, in Figure 4), the remote
method receives an object instance, for which the remote object
cannot find the class definition locally in its
<code>CLASSPATH</code>. This type of remote method call is
illustrated in Figure 4. The class of the object sent by the client
will be a subtype of the declared parameter type. A subtype is
either:</p>
<ul>
<li>An implementation of the interface that is declared as the
method parameter (or return) type</li>
<li>A subclass of the class that is declared as the method
parameter (or return) type</li>
</ul>
<img src="images/codebase-4.gif" alt=
"Illustrates passing an unknown subtype as a method parameter, as described above and below." />
<p>Figure 4: Java RMI client making a remote method call, passing
an unknown subtype as a method parameter</p>

<p>7. Like the applet's codebase, the client-specified codebase is
used to download <code class="Code">Remote</code> classes,
non-remote classes, and interfaces to other VMs. If the
<code>codebase</code> property is set on the client application,
then that codebase is annotated to the subtype instance when the
subtype class is loaded by the client. If the codebase is not set
on the client, the remote object will mistakenly use its own
codebase. <a name="section5" id="section5"></a></p>
<h2>5.0 Command-line examples</h2>
<p>In the case of an applet, the applet codebase value is embedded
in an HTML page, as we saw in the HTML example in the first section
of this tutorial.</p>
<p>In the case of Java RMI codebase, rather than having a reference
to the class embedded in an HTML page, the client first contacts
the Java RMI registry for a reference to the remote object. Because
the remote object's codebase can refer to any URL, not just one
that is relative to a known URL, the value of the Java RMI codebase
must be an absolute URL to the location of the stub class and any
other classes needed by the stub class. This value of the
<code>codebase</code> property can refer to:</p>
<ul>
<li>The URL of a directory in which the classes are organized in
package-named sub-directories</li>
<li>The URL of a JAR file in which the classes are organized in
package-named directories</li>
<li>A space-delimited string containing multiple instances of JAR
files and/or directories that meet the criteria above</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Note:</b> When the <code>codebase</code> property value is
set to the URL of a <i>directory</i>, the value must be terminated
by a &quot;/&quot;.</p>
<h3>Examples</h3>
<p>If the location of your downloadable classes is on an HTTP
server named &quot;webvector&quot;, in the directory
&quot;export&quot; (under the web root), your <code>codebase</code>
property setting might look like this:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
        -Djava.rmi.server.codebase=http://webvector/export/
</pre>
<p>If the location of your downloadable classes is on an HTTP
server named &quot;webline&quot;, in a JAR file named
&quot;mystuff.jar&quot;, in the directory &quot;public&quot; (under
the web root), your <code>codebase</code> property setting might
look like this:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
        -Djava.rmi.server.codebase=http://webline/public/mystuff.jar
</pre>
<p>Now let's suppose that the location of your downloadable classes
has been split between two JAR files, &quot;myStuff.jar&quot; and
&quot;myOtherStuff.jar&quot;. If these JAR files are located on
different servers (named &quot;webfront&quot; and
&quot;webwave&quot;), your <code>codebase</code> property setting
might look like this:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
        -Djava.rmi.server.codebase=&quot;http://webfront/myStuff.jar http://webwave/myOtherStuff.jar&quot;
</pre>

<h2>6.0 Troubleshooting tips</h2>
<p>Any serializable class, including Java RMI stubs, can be
downloaded if your Java RMI programs are configured properly. Here
are the conditions under which dynamic stub downloading will
work:</p>
<ol>
<li type="A">The stub class and any of the classes that the stub
relies on are served up from a URL reachable from the client.</li>
<li type="A">The <code class="Code">java.rmi.server.codebase</code>
property has been set on the server program (or in the case of
activation, the &quot;setup&quot; program) that makes the call to
<code class="Code">bind</code> or <code class="Code">rebind</code>,
such that:
<ul>
<li>The value of the <code>codebase</code> property is the URL in
step A
<p>and</p>
</li>
<li>If the URL specified as the value of the <code>codebase</code>
property is a directory, it must end in a trailing
&quot;/&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="sixStepC" id="sixStepC"></a></p>
</li>
<li type="A">The <code class="Code">rmiregistry</code> cannot find
the stub class or any of the classes that the stub relies on in its
<code class="Code">CLASSPATH</code>. This is so the codebase gets
annotated to the stub when the registry does its class load of the
stub, as a result of calls to <code class="Code">bind</code> or
<code class="Code">rebind</code> in the server or setup code.</li>
<li type="A">The client has installed a <code class=
"Code">SecurityManager</code> that allows the stub to be
downloaded. This means that the client must also have a properly configured
security policy file.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are two common problems associated with the <code class=
"Code">java.rmi.server.codebase</code> property, which are
discussed next.</p>
<h3 class="Heading2">6.1 If you encounter a problem running your
Java RMI server</h3>
<p>The first problem you might encounter is the receipt of a
<code class="Code">ClassNotFoundException</code> when attempting to
<code class="Code">bind</code> or <code class="Code">rebind</code>
a remote object to a name in the registry. This exception is
usually due to a malformed <code class="Code">codebase</code>
property, resulting in the registry not being able to locate the
remote object's stubs or other classes needed by the stub.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the remote object's stub implements
all the same interfaces as the remote object itself, so those
interfaces, as well as any other custom classes declared as method
parameters or return values, must also be available for download
from the specified codebase.</p>
<p>Most frequently, this exception is thrown as a result of
omitting the trailing slash from the URL value of the property.
Other reasons would include: the value of the property is not a
URL; the path to the classes specified in the URL is incorrect or
misspelled; the stub class or any other necessary classes are not
all available from the specified URL.</p>
<p>The exception that you may encounter in such a case would look
like this:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
java.rmi.ServerException: RemoteException occurred in server thread; nested exception is: 
        java.rmi.UnmarshalException: error unmarshalling arguments; nested exception is:
        java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: examples.callback.MessageReceiverImpl_Stub
java.rmi.UnmarshalException: error unmarshalling arguments; nested exception is:
        java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: examples.callback.MessageReceiverImpl_Stub
java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: examples.callback.MessageReceiverImpl_Stub

        at sun.rmi.transport.StreamRemoteCall.executeCall(Compiled Code)
        at sun.rmi.server.UnicastRef.invoke(Compiled Code)
        at sun.rmi.registry.RegistryImpl_Stub.rebind(Compiled Code)
        at java.rmi.Naming.rebind(Compiled Code)
        at examples.callback.MessageReceiverImpl.main(Compiled Code)
RemoteException occurred in server thread; nested exception is:
        java.rmi.UnmarshalException: error unmarshalling arguments; nested exception is: 
        java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: examples.callback.MessageReceiverImpl_Stub
</pre>
<h3 class="Heading2">6.2 If you encounter a problem running your
Java RMI client</h3>
<p>The second problem you could encounter is the receipt of a
<code class="Code">ClassNotFoundException</code> when attempting to
<code class="Code">lookup</code> a remote object in the registry.
If you receive this exception in a stacktrace resulting from an
attempt to run your Java RMI client code, then your problem is the
<code class="Code">CLASSPATH</code> with which your Java RMI
registry was started. See <a href="#sixStepC">requirement C in
section 6.0</a>. Here is what the exception will look like:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
java.rmi.UnmarshalException: Return value class not found; nested exception is:
        java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: MyImpl_Stub
        at sun.rmi.registry.RegistryImpl_Stub.lookup(RegistryImpl_Stub.java:109
        at java.rmi.Naming.lookup(Naming.java:60)
        at RmiClient.main(MyClient.java:28)
