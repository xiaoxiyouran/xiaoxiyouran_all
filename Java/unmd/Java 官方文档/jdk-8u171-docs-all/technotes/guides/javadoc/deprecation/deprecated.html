<h1>The @deprecated Tag</h1>

<b>"@deprecated": Mechanical Help for Abandoning Old
APIs</b>
<p>John R. Rose<br />
Oct 4, 1996</p>
<p><b>Problem:</b></p>
<p>Java 1.1 introduces many new APIs, some of which supersede older
ones. The new and old APIs co-exist in the same packages. The
superseded ones add various difficulties to the programmer's job,
the chief being the need to ignore and avoid them in most
cases.</p>
<p>Partial Solution: If we mark superseded classes, methods, and
fields clearly and unambiguously as "deprecated", the programmers
will know where to concentrate their attention. Also, the compiler
will be able to help with this process, by bringing unintentional
uses of deprecated APIs to the programmer's attention.</p>
<p><b>Details:</b></p>
<p>Within documentation comments, we define the new paragraph tag
"@deprecated". (See the Java Language Specification.) It can appear
in both class and member documentation comments, and will apply
specifically the construct its comment introduces.</p>
<p>The tagged paragraph can be empty. If it is not, it should tell
the programmer how to avoid using the deprecated feature.</p>
<p>There should be "@see" tagged paragraphs which refer to the new
versions of the same functionality.</p>
<p>As far as the compiler is concerned, the presence of the string
"@deprecated" at the beginning of a documentation comment line
(except for whitespace) causes it to place a "Deprecated" attribute
in the output classfile for the corresponding class, field, or
method.</p>
<p>Moreover, in parallel with the access checking logic for classes
and members, the compiler looks for "Deprecated" attributes of
classes and members being accessed, and issues warnings when the
deprecated classes or members are used.</p>
<p>Note that deprecation applies to classes and to individual
members, not to their names. It is possible for a single method to
have deprecated and non-deprecated overloadings. It is possible for
a non-deprecated member to hide or override a deprecated one, which
removes deprecation. It is the responsibility of the programmer to
deprecate overrides of a deprecated method, if in fact they should
be deprecated.</p>
<p>A deprecation warning is suppressed if the compilation unit
containing the deprecation is being compiled at the same time as
the compilation unit using the deprecated class or member. This
allows legacy APIs to be built without warnings. There currently is
no other way to suppress the deprecation warnings.</p>
<p>A hypothetical "-strict" option to the compiler could promote
all warnings, including deprecation warnings, to hard errors. This
is not in 1.1.</p>
<p>Javadoc should somehow highlight deprecation paragraphs, and
perhaps should place a characteristic glyph next to references to
deprecated names.</p>
<p><b>Practice:</b></p>
<p>Here is an example of the most common form of a deprecated
method:</p>
<pre>
    /**
     * @deprecated
     * @see #getPreferredSize
     */
    public Dimension preferredSize() {
        return getPreferredSize();
    }
</pre>
(Notes: The "@deprecated" tag must be followed by a space or
newline. The "@see" tag must be at the beginning of the line. See
the Java Language Specification.)
<p>If the deprecation is a simple renaming, there is no need to say
something like "this method is replaced by getPreferredSize"; the
"@see"-tagged paragraph points the user to the replacement.</p>
<p>The deprecation may be more complex if the API was reorganized
by other than a renaming of features. Here is an example of a
method that is being retracted:</p>
<pre>
    /**
     * Delete multiple items from the list.
     *
     * @deprecated  Not for public use in the future.
     * This method is expected to be retained only as a package
     * private method.
     * @see #remove(int)
     * @see #removeAll()
     */
    public synchronized void delItems(int start, int end) {
    ...
    }
</pre>
Designers of new 1.1 APIs should carefully consider whether they
are superseding old APIs. For each such API, if they wish to
encourage users of the old previous API to migrate to the new API,
they should add a deprecation paragraph to the documentation
comment. Empty deprecation paragraphs are bad form, because they do
not help the user fix the warnings that arise from the deprecation.
<p>Valid reasons for wishing one's users to migrate to the new API
include:</p>
<ul>
<li>the old API is insecure, buggy, or highly inefficient</li>
<li>the old API is going away in a future release</li>
<li>the old API encourages very bad coding practices</li>
</ul>
<p>Not all of these reasons are of equal weight, yet deprecation is
a reasonable (though not mandatory) choice in all these cases.
Therefore, the use of deprecated APIs can never be made a hard
error by default. Also, the deprecation comments need to help the
user decide when to move to the new API, and so should briefly
mention the technical reasons for deprecation.</p>
<p>(It is probably <b>not</b> good to specifically mention a
timetable for phase-out of the deprecated API; this is a business
decision that needs to be communicated other ways.)</p>
<p>It is not necessary to deprecate individual members of a
deprecated class, unless of course the programmer wants to explain
some specific point about one member.</p>
<p>When a feature is deprecated, it is a good idea to notify the
engineering organization of this fact, so that other engineers can
respond to the change (pro or con) in a timely manner.</p>
<p><b>Other Design Options:</b></p>
<p>This is the first time the compiler is in any way cognizant of
document comment contents. (Once, it made sure that they were at
the right place in the parse tree, but this is no longer true.) We
did not lightly choose to make the compiler's behavior dependent on
the contents of a comment.</p>
<p>One precedent for looking into comments is "lint", which uses
comments like /*PRINTFLIKE2*/ to annotate C APIs.</p>
<p>Note that Java documentation comments are structured, and the
structure is specified in the Java Language Specification. This
means that we "own" the format of this particular sort of comment,
so our design is somewhat more reasonable than the
less-differentiated conventions used by lint.</p>
<p>We considered introducing pragmas, and using them for
deprecation (e.g., &lt;*deprecated*&gt;) but this would open the
door very wide to many sorts of incompatible extensions and,
possibly, to serious abuses.</p>
<p>However, @deprecated does work like a pragma: It belongs in the
source, expresses information about it, but does not modify its
semantics. Unlike many pragmas, @deprecated is intended for a human
audience.</p>
<p>The compiler emits warnings as a friendly and helpful reminder,
but does not enforce any rules. It's up to the programmer to use
the contents of the deprecation paragraph. Since the human is the
primary user of the data, it belongs in comments.</p>
<p>We considered introducing a new keyword, something like
"transient". This would solve the mechanical problem, but at the
cost of modifying the language itself. In particular, we would have
to take away an identifier from coders that we had not previously
reserved (like "var"). Moreover, since the primary audience of
deprecations is humans, a keyword-based approach is insufficient,
and must be augmented by comment conventions, preferably ones which
integrate with javadoc. Thus, the keyword approach does not
pay.</p>
<p>Still, the compiler has heretofore ignored and should generally
ignore documentation comments. This is an admittedly irregular
exception to that practice. But the other design options for
deprecation involve worse sorts of irregularity.</p>
