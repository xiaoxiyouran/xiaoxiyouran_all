<h1>Java VisualVM - Working with Local Applications</h1>
<!-- ============ -->
<!-- MAIN CONTENT -->
<!-- ============ -->
<p>When you start Java VisualVM, a node for each local Java
application is displayed under the Local node in the Applications
window. You can expand an application node to see the profiler
snapshots, thread dumps and heap dumps of the application.
Right-clicking an application node or sub-node invokes a popup menu
enabling you to choose various actions.<br />
<b>Note:</b> The list of local applications always includes Java
VisualVM.</p>

"screenshot of VisualVM Applications window showing popup menu options" />
<p>A local application node generally has the following items
available in the popup menu.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Open.</b> Opens the tab for the application in the main
window where you can view application data.</li>
<li><b>Thread Dump.</b> Takes a thread dump for the
application.</li>
<li><b>Heap Dump.</b> Takes a heap dump for the application.</li>
<li><b>Profile.</b> Opens the Profiler sub-tab for the application
where you can choose to profile the application. (Note that even
though Java VisualVM appears in the application tree, Java VisualVM
cannot profile itself).</li>
<li><b>Profiler Snapshot.</b> Creates a snapshot of the results
from the profiling session. The snapshot opens in the main window
and a node for the snapshot appears under the application node.
This command is only available when Java VisualVM is profiling the
application.</li>
<li><b>Application Snapshot.</b> Creates an application snapshot
containing all application dumps and snapshots. A node for the
application snapshot appears under the Snapshots node.</li>
<li><b>Enable Heap Dump on OOME.</b> Select this if you want Java
VisualVM to automatically take a heap dump when the application
encounters an OutOfMemoryException.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can perform the following tasks directly from the popup
menu.</p>
<p><b>View Application Data</b></p>
<p>Java VisualVM displays data about each running local application
in a dedicated tab in the main window. Each application tab has
sub-tabs where information about that application is displayed.</p>
<p>To open the application tab, right-click the application node in
the Applications window and choose Open. (Alternatively,
double-click the application node.) When you click Open, the
Overview tab of the application tab opens in the main window.</p>
<p>The application tab for a local application has the following
sub-tabs:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Overview.</b> For more, see <a href=
"overview_tab.html">Viewing Application Overview</a></li>
<li><b>Monitor.</b> For more, see <a href=
"monitor_tab.html">Monitoring an Application</a></li>
<li><b>Threads.</b> For more, see <a href="threads.html">Monitoring
Application Threads</a></li>
<li><b>Profiler.</b> For more, see <a href=
"profiler.html">Profiling Applications</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Additional tabs and sub-tabs may be visible depending on the
installed plugins.</p>
<p><b>Take a Thread Dump</b></p>
<p>You can use Java VisualVM to take a thread dump to capture
information about the active application threads at the time you
take the thread dump. When you take a thread dump, the thread dump
opens in a sub-tab of the application in the main window. A node
for the thread dump appears under the application node in the
Applications window.</p>
<p>You can take a thread dump in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Right-click the application node in the Applications window and
choose Thread Dump.</li>
<li>Click the Thread Dump button in the Threads tab of the
application tab.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you take a thread dump, the thread dump opens in a sub-tab
of the application in the main window. A node for the thread dump
appears under the application node.</p>
<p>For more about working with application threads, see the
following document:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="threads.html">Monitoring Application Threads</a></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Take a Heap Dump</b></p>
<p>You can take a heap dump of a local application to capture a
snapshot of the objects on the heap.</p>
<p>You can take a heap dump in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Right-click the application node in the Applications window and
choose Heap Dump.</li>
<li>Click the Heap Dump button in the Monitor tab of the
application tab.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you take a heap dump, the heap dump opens in a sub-tab of
the application in the main window. A node for the heap dump
appears under the application node.</p>
<p>For more about working with the heap, see the following
document:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="heapdump.html">Browsing a Heap Dump</a></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Profile an Application</b></p>
<p>Java VisualVM includes a profiler that enables you to analyze
the performance and memory usage of a local application. You can
profile an application without restarting it. To start a profiling
session, right-click the application node and choosing Profile from
the popup menu to open the profiling tab.<br />
<b>Note:</b> Java VisualVM cannot be used to Profile itself.</p>
<p>For more see the following document:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="profiler.html">Profiling Applications</a></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Take Snapshots</b></p>
<p>Java VisualVM enables you to take snapshots that capture
application data at the time the snapshot is taken. You can save
snapshots to your local system and then examine them later or send
them to others.</p>
<p>Java VisualVM enables you to take the following types of
snapshots:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Profiler snapshots.</b> A profiler snapshot captures the
profiling data at the moment the snapshot is takes. The snapshot is
either a memory snapshot or a CPU snapshot. You can take a profiler
snapshot only when you are profiling an application.</li>
<li><b>Application snapshots.</b> An application snapshot is an
archive that contains all the heap dumps, thread dumps and
snapshots that are listed below the application node.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more see the following document:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="snapshots.html">Working with Snapshots</a></li>
</ul>
