#  JMX Tutorial Introductory Example : Instrumenting Your Own Applications.
#                                      Using MXBeans.
#
#  The aim of this introductory example is to show the basic features of
#  the JMX technology first by instrumenting a simple resource using the new
#  type of MBean, i.e. MXBeans, and second by performing operations on it using
#  the jconsole tool. This example shows the implementation of an MXBean, how to
#  register it in the Platform MBean Server and how to perform remote operations
#  on it by connecting to the RMI connector server using the jconsole tool. The
#  goal of this example is to show a simple MXBean that manages a resource of
#  type Queue<String>. The MXBean declares a getter getQueueSample that takes
#  a snapshot of the queue when invoked and returns a Java class QueueSample
#  that bundles the following values together: the time the snapshot was taken,
#  the queue size and the head of the queue at that given time. The MXBean also
#  declares an operation clearQueue that clears all the elements in the queue
#  being managed. The example also shows how to register this MXBean in the
#  Platform MBean Server alongside the MBeans you can already see in jconsole.
#  This examples also shows how the existing Platform MBean Server can be
#  shared between the JVM and the application itself to register the application
#  MBeans, thus avoiding the creation of multiple MBean Server instances on the
#  same JVM.

#
# In order to compile and run the example, make a copy of this README file, and
# then simply cut and paste all the commands as needed into a terminal window.
#
# This README makes the assumption that you are running under Java SE 6 on Unix,
# you are familiar with the JMX technology, and with the bourne shell or korn
# shell syntax.
#
# All the commands below are defined using Unix korn shell syntax.
#
# If you are not running Unix and korn shell you are expected to be able to
# adapt these commands to your favorite OS and shell environment.
#

# Compile Java classes
#
# The Java classes used in this example are contained in the com.example.mxbeans
# Java package.
#
# * Main.java: gets the Platform MBean Server, and creates
#              and registers the QueueSampler MXBean on it.
#
# * QueueSampler.java: implements the QueueSampler MXBean.
#
# * QueueSamplerMXBean.java: the management interface exposed
#                            by the QueueSampler MXBean.
#
# * QueueSample.java: the Java type returned by the getQueueSample()
#                     method in the QueueSampler MXBean interface.

javac com/example/mxbeans/*.java

# Start the Main application
#

java com.example.mxbeans.Main

# Start jconsole on a different shell window on the same machine
#
# JConsole is located in $(J2SE_HOME)/bin/jconsole
#

jconsole
