#
#  Example of a secure RMI connector (subject delegation).
#
#  This example uses:
#
#  - the password authenticator based on the JMXAuthenticator interface for
#    user authentication,
#  - the file access controller based on the MBeanServerForwarder interface
#    for user access level authorization,
#  - the subject delegation feature: the connection is authenticated using
#    "username" as principal but the operations and hence the authorization
#    checks are performed on behalf of the "delegate" principal. The policy
#    file grants permission to the principal "username" to perform operations
#    on behalf of the principal "delegate".
#

#
# In order to compile and run the example, make a copy of this README file, and
# then simply cut and paste all the commands as needed into a terminal window.
#
# This README makes the assumption that you are running under Java SE 6 on Unix,
# you are familiar with the JMX technology, and with the bourne shell or korn
# shell syntax.
#
# All the commands below are defined using Unix korn shell syntax.
#
# If you are not running Unix and korn shell you are expected to be able to
# adapt these commands to your favorite OS and shell environment.
#

# Compile Java classes
#
# * Server.java: creates an MBeanServer and creates and starts a secure RMI
#                connector server (JRMP).
#
# * Client.java: creates a secure RMI connector (JRMP), creates and registers
#                a Simple standard MBean and performs operations on it
#                using a delegation subject.
#
# * ClientListener.java: implements a generic notification listener.
#
# * SimpleStandard.java: implements the Simple standard MBean.
#
# * SimpleStandardMBean.java: the management interface exposed by the Simple
#                             standard MBean.
