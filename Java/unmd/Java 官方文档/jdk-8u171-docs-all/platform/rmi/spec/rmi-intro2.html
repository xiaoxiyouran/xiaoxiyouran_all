<!-- --></a> Distributed systems require that computations running
in different address spaces, potentially on different hosts, be
able to communicate. For a basic communication mechanism, the
Java<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup> programming language
supports sockets, which are flexible and sufficient for general
communication. However, sockets require the client and server to
engage in applications-level protocols to encode and decode
messages for exchange, and the design of such protocols is
cumbersome and can be error-prone.
<p><a name="a209" id="a209"><!-- --></a> An alternative to sockets
is Remote Procedure Call (RPC), which abstracts the communication
interface to the level of a procedure call. Instead of working
directly with sockets, the programmer has the illusion of calling a
local procedure, when in fact the arguments of the call are
packaged up and shipped off to the remote target of the call. RPC
systems encode arguments and return values using an external data
representation, such as XDR.</p>
<p><a name="a213" id="a213"><!-- --></a> RPC, however, does not
translate well into distributed object systems, where communication
between program-level <em>objects</em> residing in different
address spaces is needed. In order to match the semantics of object
invocation, distributed object systems require <em>remote method
invocation</em> or RMI. In such systems, a local surrogate (stub)
object manages the invocation on a remote object.</p>
<p><a name="a214" id="a214"><!-- --></a> The Java platform&#39;s
remote method invocation system described in this specification has
been specifically designed to operate in the Java application
environment. The Java programming language&#39;s RMI system assumes
the homogeneous environment of the Java virtual machine (JVM), and
the system can therefore take advantage of the Java platform&#39;s
object model whenever possible.</p>
