<h2><a name="a5112" id="a5112"><i>2.1</i> Distributed Object
Applications</a></h2>

<!-- --></a> RMI applications are often comprised of two separate
programs: a server and a client. A typical server application
creates a number of remote objects, makes references to those
remote objects accessible, and waits for clients to invoke methods
on those remote objects. A typical client application gets a remote
reference to one or more remote objects in the server and then
invokes methods on them. RMI provides the mechanism by which the
server and the client communicate and pass information back and
forth. Such an application is sometimes referred to as a
distributed object application.
<p><a name="a4851" id="a4851"><!-- --></a> Distributed object
applications need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Locate remote objects
<p>Applications can use one of two mechanisms to obtain references
to remote objects. An application can register its remote objects
with RMI's simple naming facility, the <code>rmiregistry</code>, or
the application can pass and return remote object references as
part of its normal operation.</p>
</li>
<li>Communicate with remote objects
<p>Details of communication between remote objects are handled by
RMI; to the programmer, remote communication looks like a standard
method invocation.</p>
</li>
<li>Load class bytecodes for objects that are passed as parameters
or return values
<p>Because RMI allows a caller to pass objects to remote objects,
RMI provides the necessary mechanisms for loading an object's code
as well as transmitting its data.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<a name="a4862" id="a4862"><!-- --></a> The illustration below
depicts an RMI distributed application that uses the registry to
obtain references to a remote object. The server calls the registry
to associate a name with a remote object. The client looks up the
remote object by its name in the server&#39;s registry and then
invokes a method on it. The illustration also shows that the RMI
system uses an existing web server to load bytecodes of classes
written in the Java programming language, from server to client and
from client to server, for objects when needed. RMI can load class
bytecodes using any URL protocol (e.g., HTTP, FTP, file, etc.) that
is supported by the Java platform.
