<h2><a name="a5112" id="a5112"><i>3.3</i> Garbage Collection of
Remote Objects</a></h2>
<a name="a621" id="a621"><!-- --></a> In a distributed system, just
as in the local system, it is desirable to automatically delete
those remote objects that are no longer referenced by any client.
This frees the programmer from needing to keep track of the remote
objects' clients so that it can terminate appropriately. RMI uses a
reference-counting garbage collection algorithm similar to
Modula-3&#39;s Network Objects. (See &#34;Network Objects&#34; by
Birrell, Nelson, and Owicki, <em>Digital Equipment Corporation
Systems Research Center Technical Report 115</em>, 1994.)
<p><a name="a712" id="a712"><!-- --></a> To accomplish
reference-counting garbage collection, the RMI runtime keeps track
of all live references within each Java virtual machine. When a
live reference enters a Java virtual machine, its reference count
is incremented. The first reference to an object sends a
&#34;referenced&#34; message to the server for the object. As live
references are found to be unreferenced in the local virtual
machine, the count is decremented. When the last reference has been
discarded, an unreferenced message is sent to the server. Many
subtleties exist in the protocol; most of these are related to
maintaining the ordering of referenced and unreferenced messages in
order to ensure that the object is not prematurely collected.</p>
<p><a name="a735" id="a735"><!-- --></a> When a remote object is
not referenced by any client, the RMI runtime refers to it using a
weak reference. The weak reference allows the Java virtual
machine&#39;s garbage collector to discard the object if no other
local references to the object exist. The distributed garbage
collection algorithm interacts with the local Java virtual
machine&#39;s garbage collector in the usual ways by holding normal
or weak references to objects.</p>
<p><a name="a736" id="a736"><!-- --></a> As long as a local
reference to a remote object exists, it cannot be garbage-collected
and it can be passed in remote calls or returned to clients.
Passing a remote object adds the identifier for the virtual machine
to which it was passed to the referenced set. A remote object
needing unreferenced notification must implement the
<code>java.rmi.server.Unreferenced</code> interface. When those
references no longer exist, the <code>unreferenced</code> method
will be invoked. <code>unreferenced</code> is called when the set
of references is found to be empty so it might be called more than
once. Remote objects are only collected when no more references,
either local or remote, still exist.</p>
<p><a name="a689" id="a689"><!-- --></a> Note that if a network
partition exists between a client and a remote server object, it is
possible that premature collection of the remote object will occur
(since the transport might believe that the client crashed).
Because of the possibility of premature collection, remote
references cannot guarantee referential integrity; in other words,
it is always possible that a remote reference may in fact not refer
to an existing object. An attempt to use such a reference will
generate a <code>RemoteException</code> which must be handled by
the application.</p>
