<h2><a name="a5112" id="a5112"><i>10.6</i> RMI&#39;s Multiplexing
Protocol</a></h2>
<a name="a3853" id="a3853"><!-- --></a> The purpose of multiplexing
is to provide a model where two endpoints can each open multiple
full duplex connections to the other endpoint in an environment
where only one of the endpoints is able to open such a
bidirectional connection using some other facility (e.g., a TCP
connection). RMI use this simple multiplexing protocol to allow a
client to connect to an RMI server object in some situations where
that is otherwise not possible. For example, some security managers
for applet environments disallow the creation of server sockets to
listen for incoming connections, thereby preventing such applets to
export RMI objects and service remote calls from direct socket
connections. If the applet <em>can</em> open a normal socket
connection to its codebase host, however, then it can use the
multiplexing protocol over that connection to allow the codebase
host to invoke methods on RMI objects exported by the applet. This
section describes how the format and rules of the multiplexing
protocol.
<p><br /></p>
<h3><a name="a3553" id="a3553"><!-- --></a> <i>10.6.1</i>
Definitions</h3>
<a name="a3753" id="a3753"><!-- --></a> This sections defines some
terms as they are used in the rest of the description of the
protocol.
<p><a name="a3554" id="a3554"><!-- --></a> An <em>endpoint</em> is
one of the two users of a connection using the multiplexing
protocol.</p>
<p><a name="a3864" id="a3864"><!-- --></a> The multiplexing
protocol must layer on top of one existing bidirectional, reliable
byte stream, presumably initiated by one of the endpoints to the
other. In current RMI usage, this is always a TCP connection, made
with a <code>java.net.Socket</code> object. This connection will be
referred to as the <em>concrete connection</em>.</p>
<p><a name="a3565" id="a3565"><!-- --></a> The multiplexing
protocol facilitates the use of <em>virtual connections</em>, which
are themselves bidirectional, reliable byte streams, representing a
particular session between two endpoints. The set of virtual
connections between two endpoints over a single concrete connection
comprises a <em>multiplexed connection</em>. Using the multiplexing
protocol, virtual connections can be opened and closed by either
endpoint. The state of an virtual connection with respect to a
given endpoint is defined by the elements of the multiplexing
protocol that are sent and received over the concrete connection.
Such state involves if the connection is open or closed, the actual
data that has been transmitted across, and the related flow control
mechanisms. If not otherwise qualified, the term
<em>connection</em> used in the remainder of this section means
<em>virtual connection</em>.</p>
<p><a name="a3879" id="a3879"><!-- --></a> A virtual connections
within a given multiplexed connection is identified by a 16 bit
integer, known as the <em>connection identifier</em>. Thus, there
exist 65,536 possible virtual connections in one multiplexed
connection. The implementation may limit the number of these
virtual connections that may be used simultaneously.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h3><a name="a3713" id="a3713"><!-- --></a> <i>10.6.2</i>
Connection State and Flow Control</h3>
<a name="a3892" id="a3892"><!-- --></a> Connections are manipulated
using the various <em>operations</em> defined by the multiplexing
protocol. The following are the names of the operations defined by
the protocol: OPEN, CLOSE, CLOSEACK, REQUEST, and TRANSMIT. The
exact format and rules for all the operations are detailed in
<a href="rmi-protocol7.html#a3494">Section&#160;10.6.3,
&#34;Protocol Format</a>.&#34;
<p><a name="a3904" id="a3904"><!-- --></a> The OPEN, CLOSE, and
CLOSEACK operations control connections becoming opened and closed,
while the REQUEST and TRANSMIT operations are used to transmit data
across an open connection within the constraints of the flow
control mechanism.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h3><a name="a3917" id="a3917"><!-- --></a> Connection States</h3>
<a name="a3891" id="a3891"><!-- --></a> A virtual connection is
<em>open</em> with respect to a particular endpoint if the endpoint
has sent an OPEN operation for that connection, or it has received
an OPEN operation for that connection (and it had not been
subsequently closed). The various protocol operations are described
below.
<p><a name="a3726" id="a3726"><!-- --></a> A virtual connection is
<em>pending close</em> with respect to a particular endpoint if the
endpoint has sent a CLOSE operation for that connection, but it has
not yet received a subsequent CLOSE or CLOSEACK operation for that
connection.</p>
<p><a name="a3740" id="a3740"><!-- --></a> A virtual connection is
<em>closed</em> with respect to a particular endpoint if it has
never been opened, or if it has received a CLOSE or a CLOSEACK
operation for that connection (and it has not been subsequently
opened).</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h3><a name="a3921" id="a3921"><!-- --></a> Flow Control</h3>
<a name="a3955" id="a3955"><!-- --></a> The multiplexing protocol
uses a simple packeting flow control mechanism to allow multiple
virtual connections to exist in parallel over the same concrete
connection. The high level requirement of the flow control
mechanism is that the state of all virtual connections is
independent; the state of one connection may not affect the
behavior of others. For example, if the data buffers handling data
coming in from one connection become full, this cannot prevent the
transmission and processing of data for any other connection. This
is necessary if the continuation of one connection is dependent on
the completion of the use of another connection, such as would
happen with recursive RMI calls. Therefore, the practical
implication is that the implementation must always be able to
consume and process all of the multiplexing protocol data ready for
input on the concrete connection (assuming that it conforms to this
specification).
<p><a name="a3953" id="a3953"><!-- --></a> Each endpoint has two
state values associated with each connection: how many bytes of
data the endpoint has requested but not received (<em>input request
count</em>) and how many bytes the other endpoint has requested but
have not been supplied by this endpoint (<em>output request
count</em>).</p>
<p><a name="a3779" id="a3779"><!-- --></a> An endpoint&#39;s output
request count is increased when it receives a REQUEST operation
from the other endpoint, and it is decreased when it sends a
TRANSMIT operation. An endpoint&#39;s input request count is
increased when it sends a REQUEST operation, and it is decreased
when it receives a TRANSMIT operation. It is a protocol violation
if either of these values becomes negative.</p>
<p><a name="a3780" id="a3780"><!-- --></a> It is a protocol
violation for an endpoint to send a REQUEST operation that would
increase its input request count to more bytes that it can
currently handle without blocking. It should, however, make sure
that its input request count is greater than zero if the user of
the connection is waiting to read data.</p>
<p><a name="a3781" id="a3781"><!-- --></a> It is a protocol
violation for an endpoint to send a TRANSMIT operation containing
more bytes that its output request count. It may buffer outgoing
data until the user of the connection requests that data written to
the connection be explicitly flushed. If data must be sent over the
connection, however, by either an explicit flush or because the
implementation&#39;s output buffers are full, then the user of the
connection may be blocked until sufficient TRANSMIT operations can
proceed.</p>
<p><a name="a3777" id="a3777"><!-- --></a> Beyond the rules
outlined above, implementations are free to send REQUEST and
TRANSMIT operations as deemed appropriate. For example, an endpoint
may request more data for a connection even if its input buffer is
not empty.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h3><a name="a3494" id="a3494"><!-- --></a> <i>10.6.3</i> Protocol
Format</h3>
<a name="a3495" id="a3495"><!-- --></a> The byte stream format of
the multiplexing protocol consists of a contiguous series of
variable length records. The first byte of the record is an
operation code that identifies the operation of the record and
determines the format of the rest of its content. The following
legal operation codes are defined:

<p><a name="a3797" id="a3797"><!-- --></a> To prevent identifier
collisions between the two endpoints, the space of valid connection
identifiers is divided in half, depending on the value of the most
significant bit. Each endpoint is only allowed to open connections
with a particular value for the high bit. The endpoint that
initiated the concrete connection must only open connections with
the high bit set in the identifier and the other endpoint must only
open connections with a zero in the high bit. For example, if an
RMI applet that cannot create a server socket initiates a
multiplexed connection to its codebase host, the applet may open
virtual connections in the identifier range 0x8000-7FFF, and the
server may open virtual connection in the identifier range
0-0x7FFF.</p>

the CLOSE, the connection becomes pending close for the sending
