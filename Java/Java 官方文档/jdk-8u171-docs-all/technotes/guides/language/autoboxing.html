<h1>Autoboxing</h1>

<br />
<!-- Body text begins here -->
<p>As any Java programmer knows, you can't put an <code>int</code>
(or other primitive value) into a collection. Collections can only
hold object references, so you have to <i>box</i> primitive values
into the appropriate wrapper class (which is <a href=
"../../../api/java/lang/Integer.html"><code>Integer</code></a> in
the case of <code>int</code>). When you take the object out of the
collection, you get the <code>Integer</code> that you put in; if
you need an <code>int</code>, you must <i>unbox</i> the
<code>Integer</code> using the <code>intValue</code> method. All of
this boxing and unboxing is a pain, and clutters up your code. The
autoboxing and unboxing feature automates the process, eliminating
the pain and the clutter.</p>
<p>The following example illustrates autoboxing and unboxing, along
with <a href="generics.html">generics</a> and the <a href=
"foreach.html">for-each</a> loop. In a mere ten lines of code, it
computes and prints an alphabetized frequency table of the words
appearing on the command line.</p>
<pre>
import java.util.*;

<strong>// Prints a frequency table of the words on the command line</strong>
public class Frequency {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      Map&lt;String, Integer&gt; m = new TreeMap&lt;String, Integer&gt;();
      for (String word : args) {
          Integer freq = m.get(word);
          m.put(word, (freq == null ? <strong>1 : freq + 1</strong>));
      }
      System.out.println(m);
   }
}

java Frequency if it is to be it is up to me to do the watusi
{be=1, do=1, if=1, is=2, it=2, me=1, the=1, to=3, up=1, watusi=1}
</pre>
<p>The program first declares a map from <code>String</code> to
<code>Integer</code>, associating the number of times a word occurs
on the command line with the word. Then it iterates over each word
on the command line. For each word, it looks up the word in the
map. Then it puts a revised entry for the word into the map. The
line that does this (highlighted in green) contains both autoboxing
and unboxing. To compute the new value to associate with the word,
first it looks at the current value (<code>freq</code>). If it is
null, this is the first occurrence of the word, so it puts 1 into
the map. Otherwise, it adds 1 to the number of prior occurrences
and puts that value into the map. But of course you cannot put an
<code>int</code> into a map, nor can you add one to an
<code>Integer</code>. What is really happening is this: In order to
add 1 to <code>freq</code>, it is automatically unboxed, resulting
in an expression of type <code>int</code>. Since both of the
alternative expressions in the conditional expression are of type
<code>int</code>, so too is the conditional expression itself. In
order to put this <code>int</code> value into the map, it is
automatically boxed into an <code>Integer</code>.</p>
<p>The result of all this magic is that you can largely ignore the
distinction between <code>int</code> and <code>Integer</code>, with
a few caveats. An <code>Integer</code> expression can have a
<code>null</code> value. If your program tries to autounbox null,
it will throw a <code>NullPointerException</code>. The
<code>==</code> operator performs reference identity comparisons on
<code>Integer</code> expressions and value equality comparisons on
<code>int</code> expressions. Finally, there are performance costs
associated with boxing and unboxing, even if it is done
automatically.</p>
<p>Here is another sample program featuring autoboxing and
unboxing. It is a static factory that takes an <code>int</code>
array and returns a <a href=
"../../../api/java/util/List.html"><code>List</code></a> of
<code>Integer</code> backed by the array. In a mere ten lines of
code this method provides the full richness of the
<code>List</code> interface atop an <code>int</code> array. All
changes to the list write through to the array and vice-versa. The
lines that use autoboxing or unboxing are highlighted in green:</p>
<pre>
<strong>// List adapter for primitive int array</strong>
public static List&lt;Integer&gt; asList(final int[] a) {
    return new AbstractList&lt;Integer&gt;() {
        public Integer get(int i) { <strong>return a[i];</strong> }
        // Throws NullPointerException if val == null
        public Integer set(int i, Integer val) {
            <strong>Integer oldVal = a[i];</strong>
            <strong>a[i] = val;</strong>
            return oldVal;
        }
        public int size() { return a.length; }
    };
}
</pre>
<p>The performance of the resulting list is likely to be poor, as
it boxes or unboxes on every <code>get</code> or <code>set</code>
operation. It is plenty fast enough for occasional use, but it
would be folly to use it in a performance critical inner loop.</p>
<p>So when should you use autoboxing and unboxing? Use them
<i>only</i> when there is an "impedance mismatch" between reference
types and primitives, for example, when you have to put numerical
values into a collection. It is <i>not</i> appropriate to use
autoboxing and unboxing for scientific computing, or other
performance-sensitive numerical code. An <code>Integer</code> is
<i>not</i> a substitute for an <code>int</code>; autoboxing and
unboxing blur the distinction between primitive types and reference
types, but they do not eliminate it.
