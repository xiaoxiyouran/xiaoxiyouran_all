<h1>Java Platform Debugger Architecture</h1>


<h2>Overview</h2>

The Java Platform Debugger Architecture (JPDA) consists of two
interfaces (JVM TI and JDI), a protocol (JDWP) and two software
components which tie them together (back-end and front-end). The intent of JVM TI is multi-fold:
<ul>
<li>To provide standard interfaces (for the sake of simplicity we
will refer to JDWP as an interface) which allow Java programming
language debugging tools to be easily written without regard to
platform specifics such hardware, operating system and virtual
machine implementation.</li>
<li>To describe a complete architecture for implementing these
interfaces, including remote and cross-platform debugging.</li>
<li>To provide a reference implementation of this
architecture.</li>
<li>To provide a highly modular architecture where the
implementation and/or client of an interface can be different than
the reference implementation or different from the JPDA
component.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Background</h2>
See <a href="architecture.html">Java Platform Debugger
Architecture</a>.
<h2>Modularity</h2>
Details of the modular structure of JPDA are discussed below. In
each case the standard JPDA usage is described. The reference
implementation is described and alternative implementations and
clients of the interface are discussed.
<h3><a name="modularity" id="modularity">JVM TI Modularity</a></h3>
The Java Virtual Machine Tool Interface (JVM TI) describes the
functionality provided by a virtual machine (VM) in order to allow
debugging of Java programming language applications running under
this VM. In JPDA, JVM TI is implemented by a VM and the client is
the JPDA back-end. In the reference implementation of JPDA, JVM TI
is implemented by the Java HotSpot VM and the client is the
reference implementation of the back-end, supplied as a native
shared library (jdwp.so, jdwp.dll, ...), which is shipped with the
JDK.
<p>Many VMs other than the Java HotSpot VM implement JVM TI. The
reference implementation of the back-end has been ported to other
platforms. And there are JVM TI clients other than the back-end,
most notably agents for applications that allow debugging of both
native and Java programming language code, and thus need native
level control and information. We are aware of no clean-room
implementations of the back-end, although this is possible - and a
lot of work.</p>
<h3>JDWP Modularity</h3>
The Java Debug Wire Protocol (JDWP) describes the format of
debugging information and requests between a debuggee and a
debugger. In JPDA, there is a communication channel between the
front-end (in the debugger process) and the back-end (in the
debuggee process) - the format of data flowing on this channel is
described by JDWP. In the reference implementation of JPDA, the
reference implementation of the back-end (above) provides the
debuggee side of this channel, and the reference implementation of
the front-end (a Java programming language component of the JDK,
located in tools.jar) provides the debugger side.
<p>JVM TI is problematic to implement in some VMs. JDWP is
implemented directly in such VMs. On the client side, an
application written in a language other than the Java programming
language may not be an optimal candidate for using JDI. Some have
chosen to be clients of JDWP.</p>
<h3>JDI Modularity</h3>
The Java Debug Interface (JDI) provides a pure Java programming
language interface for debugging Java programming language
applications. In JPDA, the JDI is a remote view in the debugger
process of a virtual machine in the debuggee process. It is
implemented by the front-end (above) while a debugger-like
application (IDE, debugger, tracer, monitoring tool, ...) is the
client.
<p>The JDI could be implemented by a system with a static view of
an application. It could be implemented by a system with a
mechanism utterly different than JDWP/front-end for collecting
information or controlling a VM.</p>
<h2><a name="walk-through" id="walk-through">Walk-through</a></h2>
The various ways that the interfaces can be used is discussed
above. This section will examine how the standard full JPDA works.
The examples go into detail about specific calls and codes. It is
not important to understand these -- they are present only to make
the examples more concrete.
<p>Across each interface there are two classes of activity:
requests and events. Requests originate on the debugger side and
include queries for information, setting of state changes in the
remote VM/application, and setting of debugging state. Events
originate on the debuggee side and denote changes of state in the
remote VM/application.</p>
<p>Let's walk through an example. A user clicks on a local variable
in a stack view in an IDE, requesting its value. The IDE uses the
JDI to get the value, in particular it calls the
<code>getValue</code> method, for example:</p>
<pre>
    theStackFrame.getValue(theLocalVariable)
</pre>
Where <code>theStackFrame</code> is a <a href=
"../../../jdk/api/jpda/jdi/com/sun/jdi/StackFrame.html"><code>com.sun.jdi.StackFrame</code></a>
and <code>theLocalVariable</code> is a <a href=
"../../../jdk/api/jpda/jdi/com/sun/jdi/LocalVariable.html"><code>com.sun.jdi.LocalVariable</code></a>.
<p>The front-end then sends this query over a communications
channel (let's say a socket) to the back-end running in the
debuggee process. It sends it by formatting it into a byte stream
in accordance with the JDWP. In particular, it sends a GetValues
command (byte value: 1) in the StackFrame command set (byte value:
16), followed by the thread ID, frame ID, etc.</p>
<p>The back-end deciphers the byte-stream and sends the query off
to the VM through the JVM TI. In particular, let's say the
requested value is an integer, the following JVM TI function call
is made:</p>
<pre>
    error = jvmti-&gt;GetLocalInt(frame, slot, &amp;intValue);
</pre>
The back-end sends back across the socket, a response packet, which
will include the value of <code>intValue</code>, and which will be
formatted according to JDWP. The front-end deciphers the response
packet and returns the value as the value of the
<code>getValue</code> method call. The IDE then displays the value.
<p>Requests to change debugging state are processed in a similar
manner. For example, a request to set a breakpoint goes through the
same steps -- although, of course, the JDI methods called, the JDWP
commands sent, and the JVM TI functions called are different.
Additionally, the front-end and back-end do more than shove data
back and forth, they track and schedule activity and convert,
filter, and cache information, so a breakpoint request will be
processed quite differently than a get value query - but the
communication sequence will be the same.</p>
<p>What happens when the application being debugged finally hits
this breakpoint? This is where events come into play. The virtual
machine sends an event across the JVM TI interface. In particular,
it calls the event handling function passing the breakpoint:</p>
<p>The back-end has set the event handling function to be:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
static void Breakpoint(jvmtiEnv *jvmti_env,
                       JNIEnv* jni_env, jthread thread,
                       jmethodID method, jlocation location)
{ ...
</pre>
This back-end function starts a chain of activity which filters the
event to see if it is interesting, queues it, and sends it across
the socket in the JDWP format defined for breakpoint events. The
front-end decodes and processes the event, eventually generating a
JDI event. In particular, the JDI event is exposing it as a
<a href="../../../jdk/api/jpda/jdi/com/sun/jdi/event/BreakpointEvent.html">
<code>com.sun.tools.jdi.event.BreakpointEvent</code></a>. The IDE
then gets the event by removing it from the event queue:
<pre>
    theEventQueue.remove()
</pre>
where <code>theEventQueue</code> is a <a href=
"../../../jdk/api/jpda/jdi/com/sun/jdi/event/EventQueue.html"><code>
com.sun.jdi.event.EventQueue</code></a>. The IDE will probably
update its displays by making many query calls across the JDI.
<h2><a name="porting" id="porting">Porting</a></h2>
Each virtual machine implementation needs its own JVM TI
implementation -- a JVM TI implementation must dig deeply into VM
data structures and must set hooks into the VM implementation in
order to get events. Adding JVMDT to a VM without JVM TI support is
a significant undertaking. Depending on the complexity of the VM
and the amount of optional JVM TI implemented, it might be a three
to twelve month project. Porting a VM which has JVM TI support to a
new platform is primarily the work of porting the non-JVM TI
portions of the VM -- JVM TI adds a comparatively small amount of
work.
<p>The reference implementation of the back-end can usually be
moved to a new platform with little (a few lines) or no change to
the source and then recompiled. To use a new VM on the same
platform, the binary of the back-end should generally work --
although, it's not Java programming language code so you never
know. Note that licensing issues are not covered by this
document.</p>
<p>The front-end implementation is written in the Java programming
language and will run on any platform or VM. However, the connector
code has functionality that may need to be extended for some
systems. For example, the reference implementation of the front-end
includes a launcher which assumes virtual machines are launched
using Java SE conventions. A user of the JDI can configure any
launcher syntax he or she wants, but generally a debugger
application would prefer to leave this to the JDI implementation.
If a different type of communication channel is desired (serial,
for example) this too would need to be added using the <a href=

5.0.</p>
