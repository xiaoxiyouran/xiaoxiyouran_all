<h2>The AWT Native Interface</h2>
<h3>The Key to Rendering to an AWT Canvas from Native Code</h3>
<p>The new Java SE AWT Native Interface enables rendering
libraries compiled to native code to draw directly to a Java
<tt>Canvas</tt> drawing surface. This means that such libraries can
be used without being converted to Java first and without
significant impact on performance. An example illustrating how easy
it is to use the AWT Native Interface is presented and discussed in
this technical note.</p>
<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p>The definition of Java Standard Edition includes JNI, the Java
Native Interface. Most Java developers will never need to use it,
but the interface is invaluable in certain situations because it
provides the only way for Java byte code to interact directly with
application code that has been compiled to the native machine
instructions for the host microprocessor. JNI is most often used as
an ``escape valve'' to enable access to platform functionality not
yet supported by the Java programming language. For example, you
could use JNI to integrate with native code that communicates with
a peripheral device, such as a scanner, connected to a system via a
USB port.</p>
<p>Of course, JNI is general enough to be used to access almost any
sort of native library, regardless of whether the task to be
accomplished could also be done using pure Java. The major penalty
for using it is that code portability suffers, but this may be
acceptable or even necessary for business or technical reasons.</p>
<p>Business reasons? Consider the situation where the legacy
software you are trying to port to Java uses a third-party library
for a critical set of operations. If you do not have source rights
to this library and you cannot convince the owner to provide a Java
version, you may not be able to use it. Even if you do have the
source, the effort needed to port a standard library to Java and
test it may be too expensive to consider.</p>
<p>Another important reason for leaving the native code alone is
related to performance. If you are dealing with a finely crafted
piece of code, carefully tuned for performance over the course of
years, you probably do not want to convert it to Java and risk a
performance penalty. It is usually best to keep it intact until you
are satisfied that the benefits of Java portability and code
maintainability outweigh the expected performance difference.</p>
<p>A rendering library is a good example of a piece of native code
that most developers would just as soon leave alone for performance
reasons. Unfortunately, this is the very type of library that has
been most difficult to integrate with Java code through JNI. The
fundamental problem has been that the rendering code cannot
identify where to draw. It needs access to information about a Java
drawing surface (such as a handle to the underlying peer of a
<tt>Canvas</tt>), but cannot get it.</p>
<p>Until now, the Java platform has kept access to this information
private &mdash; "private" in the sense of undocumented,
unsupported, and deprecated. The good news is that this situation
will be remedied with the introduction of the "AWT Native
Interface" in the Java upgrade release ("Kestrel"). For the first
time there will be an official way to obtain all the information
you need to know about the peer of a Java <tt>Canvas</tt> so that
you can draw directly to the <tt>Canvas</tt> from a native code
library using the drawing routines provided by the operating
system.</p>
<p><b>How It Works</b></p>
<p>In this section we'll describe the most common usage of the AWT
Native Interface &mdash; overriding the <tt>paint</tt> method to
direct drawing operations to a native rendering library which then
queries the Java VM to determine the information it needs in order
to render. Note, however, that any native code may use the AWT
Native Interface to learn about a target drawing surface, not just
code in a <tt>paint</tt> method.</p>
<p>The first step in hooking up a native rendering library to a
Java <tt>Canvas</tt> is to define a new class that extends
<tt>Canvas</tt> and overrides the <tt>paint</tt> method. The Java
system routes all drawing operations for a <tt>Canvas</tt> object
through the <tt>paint</tt> method, as it does for all other GUI
objects.</p>
<p>The new <tt>paint</tt> method, to be implemented in the native
rendering library, must be declared as <tt>public native void</tt>
, and the native library itself is loaded at runtime by including a
call to <tt>System.loadLibrary( &quot;myRenderingLib&quot;)</tt>in
the <tt>static</tt> block of the class. The <tt>myRenderingLib</tt>
name is used for the native shared library; for the Solaris
operating environment, the actual name for the library file on disk
is <tt>libmyRenderingLib.so</tt> .</p>
<p>Here is a simple example of such a class:</p>
<pre>
import java.awt.*;
import java.awt.event.*;

public class MyCanvas extends Canvas {
    static {
        System.loadLibrary("myRenderingLib");
    }
    public native void paint(Graphics g);

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Frame f = new Frame();
        f.setBounds(0, 0, 500, 110);
        f.add( new MyCanvas() );
        f.addWindowListener( new WindowAdapter() {
            public void windowClosing(WindowEvent ev) {
                System.exit(0);
            }
        } );
        f.show();
    }
}
<br />
</pre>
<p>Note that this class has a <tt>main</tt> method that can be used
torun this code as an application for testing purposes.</p>
<p>The next step is to run the <tt>javah</tt> tool on the
<tt>MyCanvas</tt> class file above to generate a C/C++ header file
that describes the interface to the native <tt>paint</tt> method
that Java expects to be used. <tt>javah</tt> is a standard tool
included with the Java SDK.</p>
<p>The final step &#173; the most interesting one &#173; is to
write the native rendering method, with an interface that conforms
to the header file that <tt>javah</tt> generated, and build it as a
standard shared library (called <tt>myRenderingLib</tt> in the
above example) by linking it, for the Solaris operating
environment, against the <tt>jre/lib/sparc/libjawt.so</tt> library.
(For Microsoft Windows, link against the <tt>jre/bin/jawt.dll</tt>
library.) This code will call back to the Java virtual machine to
get the drawing surface information it needs to access the
<tt>MyCanvas</tt> peer. Once this information is available, the
code can draw directly to <tt>MyCanvas</tt> using standard drawing
routines supplied by the underlying operating system.</p>
<p>Here is sample source code for a native <tt>paint</tt> method
designed for use in a Solaris X11-based drawing environment and a
Java VM where the AWT Native Interface is present:</p>
<pre>

    char        *testString = "^^^ rendered from native code ^^^";

    /* Get the AWT */
    awt.version = JAWT_VERSION_1_3;
    if (JAWT_GetAWT(env, &amp;awt) == JNI_FALSE) {
        printf("AWT Not found\n");
        return;
    }

    /* Get the drawing surface */
    ds = awt.GetDrawingSurface(env, canvas);
    if (ds == NULL) {
        printf("NULL drawing surface\n");
        return;

        awt.FreeDrawingSurface(ds);
        return;
    }

    /* Get the platform-specific drawing info */
    dsi_x11 = (JAWT_X11DrawingSurfaceInfo*)dsi-&gt;platformInfo;


    /* Now paint */
    gc = XCreateGC(dsi_x11-&gt;display, dsi_x11-&gt;drawable, 0, 0);
    XSetBackground(dsi_x11-&gt;display, gc, 0);
    for (i=0; i&lt;36;i++)
    {
        XSetForeground(dsi_x11-&gt;display, gc, 10*i);
        XFillRectangle(dsi_x11-&gt;display, dsi_x11-&gt;drawable, gc,
                        10*i, 5, 90, 90);
    }
    XSetForeground(dsi_x11-&gt;display, gc, 155);
    XDrawImageString(dsi_x11-&gt;display, dsi_x11-&gt;drawable, gc,
                        100, 110, testString, strlen(testString));
    XFreeGC(dsi_x11-&gt;display, gc);


    /* Free the drawing surface info */
    ds-&gt;FreeDrawingSurfaceInfo(dsi);

    /* Unlock the drawing surface */
    ds-&gt;Unlock(ds);

    /* Free the drawing surface */
    awt.FreeDrawingSurface(ds);
}
</pre>
<p>The key data structure here is <tt>JAWT</tt> , which is defined
in <tt>jawt.h</tt> (included by <tt>jawt_md.h)</tt> ; it provides
access to all the information the native code needs to get the job
done. The first part of the native method is boilerplate: it
populates the <tt>JAWT</tt> structure, gets a
<tt>JAWT_DrawingSurface</tt> structure, locks the surface (only one
drawing engine at a time, please!), then gets a
<tt>JAWT_DrawingSurfaceInfo</tt> structure that contains a pointer
(in the <tt>platformInfo</tt> field) to the necessary
platform-specific drawing information. It also includes the
bounding rectangle of the drawing surface and the current clipping
region.</p>
<p>The structure of the information pointed to by
<tt>platformInfo</tt> is defined in a machine-dependent header file
called <tt>jawt_md.h</tt>. For Solaris/X11 drawing, it includes
information about the X11 display and X11 drawable associated with
<tt>MyCanvas</tt>. After the drawing operations are completed,
there is more boilerplate code as <tt>JAWT_DrawingSurfaceInfo</tt>
is freed and <tt>JAWT_DrawingSurface</tt> is unlocked and
freed.</p>
<p>The corresponding code for the Microsoft Windows platform would
be structured similarly, but would include the version of
<tt>jawt_md.h</tt> for Microsoft Windows and the structure located
in the <tt>platformInfo</tt> field of drawing surface info would be
cast as a <tt>JAWT_Win32DrawingSurfaceInfo*</tt> . And, of course,
the actual drawing operations would need to be changed to those
appropriate for the Microsoft Windows platform.</p>
<p><b>Summary</b></p>
<p>The ability to draw directly into a Java <tt>Canvas</tt> from a
native code library is extremely useful for developers planning to
migrate a legacy software system to Java, especially one that
includes a high-performance rendering engine. It makes it much
easier to migrate in stages, leaving performance-sensitive
rendering code alone, while other less-sensitive portions of code
are converted to Java. The result can be a modern Java-centric
application, providing the benefit of portability and development
efficiency, but one that does not sacrifice an investment in
performance of a key piece of native code.</p>
