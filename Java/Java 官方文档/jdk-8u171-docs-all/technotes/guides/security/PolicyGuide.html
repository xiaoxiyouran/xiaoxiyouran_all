<h2><a name="Introduction" id="Introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>The policy for a Java runtime (specifying which <a href=
"../../guides/security/permissions.html">permissions</a> are
available for code from various sources, when executing as various
principals) is represented by a Policy object. The default Policy
implementation obtains its information from static ASCII policy
configuration files.</p>
<p>A policy file can be composed via a simple text editor, or via
the graphical <b>Policy Tool</b> utility described in this
document. Using the <b>Policy Tool</b> saves typing and eliminates
the need for you to know the required <a href=
"../../guides/security/PolicyFiles.html#FileSyntax">policy file
syntax</a> thus reducing errors.</p>
<p>The <a href="#Usage">Policy Tool Usage</a> section describes how
to use the <b>Policy Tool</b> to create and modify policy
files.</p>
<p>The <a href="#Examples">Examples</a> section provides detailed
examples of the use of <b>Policy Tool</b>.</p>
<p>The <a href="#SeeAlso">See Also</a> section provides links to
related documentation.</p>
<h2><a name="Usage" id="Usage">Policy Tool Usage</a></h2>
<h3><a name="StartTool" id="StartTool">Starting Policy
Tool</a></h3>
<p>To start <b>Policy Tool</b>, simply type the following at the
command line.</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
  policytool
</pre>
<p>This brings up the "Policy Tool" window.</p>
<p>Whenever Policy Tool is started, it tries to fill in this window
with policy information from what is sometimes referred to as the
"user policy file". The user policy file is by default a file named
<code>.java.policy</code> in your home directory. If Policy Tool
cannot find the user policy file, it reports the situation and
displays a blank "Policy Tool" window (that is, a window with
headings and buttons but no data in it):</p>
<p><img src="images/ptBlank.gif" alt=
"Policy Tool window to add, edit, or remove a policy" /></p>
<p>You can then proceed to either <a href="#Open">open</a> whatever
policy file you want to work on or create a new policy file, by
<a href="#AddEntry">adding policy entries</a>, optionally <a href=
"#SpecifyKeystore">specifying a keystore</a>, and <a href=
"#SaveFile">saving the file</a>).</p>
<p>The first time you run the <b>Policy Tool</b>, there will not be
a user policy file (unless you created one manually).</p>
<h3><a name="Create" id="Create">Creating a new Policy
File</a></h3>
<p>To create a new policy file, start by simply selecting the
<b>New</b> command from the <b>File</b> menu. This will close the
currently open policy file (if any, after first prompting you to
save it if needed) and bring up a new policy tool window, that is,
a window with headings and buttons but no data in it.</p>
<p>Please Note: this is not necessary the first time you run the
Policy Tool. Since the tool tries to open the user policy file and
one doesn't exist yet (unless it was created manually), the tool
will bring up a window without any data in it.</p>
<p>Once you have a new policy tool window, you can then <a href=
"#AddEntry">create the policy entries</a>, and <a href=
"#SpecifyKeystore">specify the keystore</a> (if any of the policy
entries specify a keystore alias). At any point, you can <a href=
"#SaveFile">save the policy file</a>.</p>
<h3><a name="Open" id="Open">Opening a Different Policy
File</a></h3>
<p>To work on a different policy file than the one currently being
worked on (if any), use the <b>Open</b> command in the <b>File</b>
menu.</p>
<p>This will close the currently open policy file (if any, after
first prompting you to save it if needed) and will present you with
an Open dialog, which you can use to navigate the directory
structure until you get to the directory containing the policy file
you want to work on. Select that file, then select the <b>OK</b>
button.</p>
<p>The "Policy Tool" window will then be filled in with information
from the policy file, including the policy file name, the keystore
URL (if any), and the CodeBase, SignedBy and Principal parts of
each policy entry in the policy file.</p>
<h3><a name="SpecifyKeystore" id="SpecifyKeystore"></a>Specifying
the Keystore</h3>
<p>To specify the keystore containing the key information for the
aliases specified in the SignedBy parts of policy entries, select
the <b>Edit</b> command in the <b>Keystore</b> menu.</p>
<p>This brings up a dialog box in which you specify the new
keystore URL and optionally the keystore type.</p>
<p>As an example, to specify the keystore named "mykeystore" in the
<code>/tests/</code> directory, type the following
<code>file:</code> URL into the text box labeled "New KeyStore
URL".</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
  file:/tests/mykeystore
</pre>
<p>To also specify that the keystore type is "JKS" (the proprietary
keystore type supported by Oracle), type the following
into the text box labeled "New KeyStore Type".</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
  JKS
</pre>
<p>When you are done specifying the keystore URL and type (if any),
select <b>OK</b> (or you can select <b>Cancel</b> to cancel the
operation). If you didn't cancel, the text box labeled "Keystore:"
is now filled in with the keystore URL and type.</p>
<h3><a name="AddEntry" id="AddEntry"></a>Adding a New Policy
Entry</h3>
<p>To add a new policy entry, select the <b>Add Policy Entry</b>
button in the main "Policy Tool" window.</p>
<p>This brings up a "Policy Entry" dialog box:</p>
<p><img src="images/AddEntryBlank.gif" alt=
"Policy Entry dialog to add a policy entry" /></p>
<p>Using this dialog box, you specify</p>
<ul>
<li>an optional <b>CodeBase</b> entry indicating the URL location
where the code originates from. For example, to indicate code from
the local <code>/TESTS/</code> directory, type the
following file URL into the <b>CodeBase</b> text box:
<pre class="codeblock">
  file:/TESTS/
</pre></li>
<li>an optional <b>SignedBy</b> entry indicating the alias name
from the keystore used to reference the signer whose private key
was used to sign the code. For example, to indicate the alias named
"Signer", simply type the following into the <b>SignedBy</b> text
box:
<pre class="codeblock">
  Signer
</pre></li>
<li>an optional <b>Principals</b> entry indicating the list of
principals that the code has to be executed as in order for the
permission(s) to be granted. See <a href="#AddPrincipal">Adding a
New Principal</a>.</li>
<li>one or more <b>permission</b> entries indicating which
permissions are granted to the code from the source indicated by
the CodeBase and SignedBy values (or to any code if no such values
are specified) when running as the specified principals in the
Principals list. See <a href="#AddPerm">Adding a New
Permission</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <b>SignedBy</b> value is a string alias that is mapped
(using the keystore) to a set of public keys that are associated
with the signers. These keys are used to verify that classes from
the specified code source are really signed by these signers.</p>
<p>The <b>SignedBy</b> value can be a comma-separated string
containing names of multiple signers, an example of which is
"Adam,Eve,Charles", which means "signed by Adam and Eve and
Charles" (i.e., the relationship is AND, not OR).</p>
<p>The <b>SignedBy</b> value is optional in that, if it is omitted,
it signifies "any signer," or in other words, it doesn't matter
whether the code is signed or not. Similarly, if there is no
<b>CodeBase</b> entry, then it signifies "any code"; it doesn't
matter where the code originates from.</p>
<p>Thus, if there is no <b>CodeBase</b> entry, then all code signed
by the specified alias(es) will be granted the specified
permissions. If there is no <b>SignedBy</b> entry, then all code
from the specified <b>CodeBase</b> will be granted the specified
permissions, regardless of whether the code is signed or not, and
by whom. If there is no <b>CodeBase</b> entry, and also no
<b>SignedBy</b> entry, then all code will be granted the specified
permissions.</p>
<p>Note: The exact meaning of a <b>CodeBase</b> value depends on
the characters at the end. A <b>CodeBase</b> with a trailing "/"
matches all class files (not JAR files) in the specified directory.
A <b>CodeBase</b> with a trailing "/*" matches all files (both
class and JAR files) contained in that directory. A <b>CodeBase</b>
with a trailing "/-" matches all files (both class and JAR files)
in the directory and recursively all files in subdirectories
contained in that directory.</p>
<p>The <b>Principals</b> entry specifies a list of "principal
values". Each principal value specifies a
principal_type/principal_name pair which must be present within the
executing thread's principal set. The Principals entry is optional
in that, if it is omitted, it signifies "any principals".</p>
<p>If there is no principal_type specified and the principal_name
is a quoted string, the string is treated as a keystore alias when
the policy file is processed at runtime. The keystore is consulted
and queried (via the alias) for an X509 Certificate. If one is
found, the principal type is automatically assumed to be
javax.security.auth.x500.X500Principal, and the actual principal
name is assumed to be the subject distinguished name from the
certificate. If an X509 Certificate mapping is not found, the
entire policy entry granting permissions to the specified principal
is ignored.</p>
<h4><a name="AddPrincipal" id="AddPrincipal"></a>Adding a New
Principal</h4>
<p>To add a new principal, select the <b>Add Principal</b> button
in the "Policy Entry" dialog box. This brings up the "Principals"
dialog box:</p>
<p><img src="images/AddPrincipalBlank.gif" alt=
"Principals dialog to add a principal" /></p>
<p>To add the principal:</p>
<ol>
<li>Type or select a <b>principal type</b>.
<p>The drop-down list labeled "Principal Type:" contains a list of
built-in principal types. If you want such a type, select it from
the list, and the complete principal type name appears in the text
box to the right of the drop-down list.</p>
<p>If you instead want to specify a principal type defined by you
or others, type the principal type into the text box.</p>
</li>
<li>Type a <b>principal name</b>.
<p>Type the principal name directly into the text box to the right
of the "Principal Name:" text box. For example, to specify the
principal named <code>Signer</code>, type</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
Signer
</pre></li>
</ol>
<p>When you are done specifying the principal information, select
the <b>OK</b> button (or <b>Cancel</b> to cancel). The new
principal appears in a line in the "Principals" entry.</p>
<p>You can then add additional principals by following the same
sequence of steps. Or you can <a href="#EditPrincipal">edit</a> or
<a href="#RemovePrincipal">remove</a> an existing principal.</p>
<h4><a name="EditPrincipal" id="EditPrincipal">Editing a
Principal</a></h4>
<p>To edit an existing principal, select the line for that
principal in the "Principals:" entry, then select the <b>Edit
Principal</b> button. Alternatively, you can simply double-click
the line for that principal.</p>
<p>This brings up the same type of "Principals" dialog box as
appears when you are <a href="#AddPrincipal">adding</a> a new
principal, except in this case the dialog box is filled in with the
existing principal information. To change the information, either
make new selections from the drop-down lists or replace the
information in the text boxes.</p>
<p>When you are done, select the <b>OK</b> button (or <b>Cancel</b>
to cancel changes). The Principals:" entry now shows the principal
with your modifications.</p>
<h4><a name="RemovePrincipal" id="RemovePrincipal">Removing a
Principal</a></h4>
<p>To remove an existing principal, select the line for that
principal in the "Principals:" entry, then select the <b>Remove
Principal</b> button.</p>
<h4><a name="AddPerm" id="AddPerm"></a>Adding a New Permission</h4>
<p>To add a new permission, select the <b>Add Permission</b> button
in the "Policy Entry" dialog box. This brings up the "Permissions"
dialog box:</p>
<p><img src="images/AddPermBlank.gif" alt=
"Permissions dialog to add a new permission" /></p>
<p>To add the permission:</p>
<ol>
<li>Type or select a <b>permission type</b>.
<p>The drop-down list labeled "Permission:" contains a list of
built-in permission types. If you want such a type, select it from
the list, and the complete permission type name appears in the text
box to the right of the drop-down list.</p>
<p>If you instead want to specify a permission type defined by you
or others, type the permission type into the text box.</p>
</li>
<li>Type or select a permission <b>target name</b>.
<p>If you selected a built-in permission from the "Permission:"
drop-down list, and permissions of that type have specific target
name values, then the drop-down list labeled "Target Name:"
contains a list of those values, from which you can choose.</p>
<p>In some cases, where the target name possibilities are infinite
but there are some built-in target name specifications that have
special meaning, such target names will appear in the drop-down
list. For example, the special target name of "&lt;&lt;All
Files&gt;&gt;" will appear in the list for File Permissions.</p>
<p>To specify a target name not available in the drop-down list,
type the target name directly into the text box to the right of the
"Target Name:" drop-down list. For example, to specify the file
named <code>data</code> in the <code>/ptTest/</code>
directory, type</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
  /ptTest/data
</pre></li>
<li>Type or select one or more <b>actions</b>, if actions are
relevant.
<p>Some permissions just have a target name, but no actions. For
such permissions, leave the text box to the right of the "Actions:"
drop-down list blank. (It will automatically be darkened and
unavailable for this type of built-in permission.)</p>
<p>For permissions requiring action specifications, type the
comma-separated list of actions into the text box, or select them
from the drop-down list. For example, to specify both read and
write access to a file specified for a File Permission, first
select <code>read</code> (or <code>write</code>, order doesn't
matter) from the list. The word "read" appears in the text box.
Then select <code>write</code>, and the word "write" will be
appended, preceded by a comma and a space.</p>
</li>
<li>Type a <b>SignedBy</b> alias into the text box to the right of
the "Signed By" label, if required. The <b>SignedBy</b> value for a
permission entry is optional. If present, it indicates a signed
permission. That is, the permission class itself must be signed by
the given alias(es) in order for the permission to be granted.</li>
</ol>
<p>When you are done specifying the permission information, select
the <b>OK</b> button (or <b>Cancel</b> to cancel). The new
permission appears in a line in the "Policy Entry" dialog.</p>
<p>You can then add additional permissions by following the same
sequence of steps. Or you can <a href="#EditPerm">edit</a> an
existing permission or <a href="#RemovePerm">remove</a> a
permission.</p>
<h4><a name="EditPerm" id="EditPerm">Editing a Permission</a></h4>
<p>To edit an existing permission, select the line for that
permission in the "Policy Entry" dialog box, then select the
<b>Edit Permission</b> button. Alternatively, you can simply
double-click the line for that permission.</p>
<p>This brings up the same type of "Permissions" dialog box as
appears when you are <a href="#AddPerm">adding</a> a new
permission, except in this case the dialog box is filled in with
the existing permission information. To change the information,
either make new selections from the drop-down lists or replace the
information in the text boxes.</p>
<p>When you are done, select the <b>OK</b> button (or <b>Cancel</b>
to cancel changes). The "Policy Entry" dialog now shows the
permission with any modifications you made.</p>
<h4><a name="RemovePerm" id="RemovePerm"></a>Removing a
Permission</h4>
<p>To remove an existing permission, select the line for that
permission in the "Policy Entry" dialog box, then select the
<b>Remove Permission</b> button.</p>
<h4><a name="EntryDone" id="EntryDone"></a>Completing the Addition
of a Policy Entry</h4>
<p>Once you are done adding a policy entry, select the <b>Done</b>
button in the "Policy Entry" dialog, or <b>Cancel</b> to
cancel.</p>
<p>If you selected <b>Done</b>, the "Policy Tool" window now
contains a line representing the policy entry. The line contains
the CodeBase, SignedBy and Principals information (if any). If none
was specified in the "Policy Entry" dialog, just</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
  CodeBase &lt;ALL&gt;
</pre>
<p>appears.</p>
<p>Note: a warning is displayed upon closing the policy entry if it
contains any <b>SignedBy</b> aliases that don't yet exist in your
keystore. Select <b>OK</b> and make a note to create such an alias,
or <a href="#EditEntry">edit the policy entry</a> to fix the alias
if was wrong.</p>
<h3><a name="EditEntry" id="EditEntry"></a>Editing a Policy
Entry</h3>
<p>To edit an existing policy entry, select the line for that entry
in the main "Policy Tool" window, then select the <b>Edit Policy
Entry</b> button. Alternatively, you can simply double-click the
line for that entry.</p>
<p>This brings up the same type of "Policy Entry" dialog box as
appears when you are <a href="#AddEntry">adding</a> a new policy
entry, except in this case the dialog box is filled in with the
existing policy entry information. To change the information,
simply retype it (for the <b>CodeBase</b> and <b>SignedBy</b>
values) or use the buttons (for the <b>Principals</b> and
<b>Permissions</b> values).</p>
<p>When you are done, select the <b>Done</b> button (or
<b>Cancel</b> to cancel).</p>
<h3><a name="RemoveEntry" id="RemoveEntry"></a>Removing a Policy
Entry</h3>
<p>To delete a policy entry from the policy file, select the line
for that entry in the main "Policy Tool" window, then select the
<b>Remove Policy Entry</b> button.</p>
<p>The complete policy entry is displayed, and you can then either
select <b>OK</b> to remove the entry, or <b>Cancel</b> to keep
it.</p>
<h3><a name="SaveFile" id="SaveFile"></a>Saving the Policy
File</h3>
<p>To save changes to an existing policy file, simply select the
<b>Save</b> command in the <b>File</b> menu.</p>
<p>To save a new policy file you've been creating, or to copy an
existing policy file to a new policy file with a different name,
select the <b>Save As</b> command from the <b>File</b> menu. This
brings up the Save As dialog box.</p>
<p>Navigate the directory structure to get to the directory in
which you want to save the policy file. Type the desired file name,
then select the <b>OK</b> button. The policy file is now saved, and
its name and path are shown in the text box labeled "Policy
File:"</p>
<h3><a name="ExitTool" id="ExitTool"></a>Exiting the Policy
Tool</h3>
<p>To exit <b>Policy Tool</b>, select the <b>Exit</b> command from
the <b>File</b> menu.</p>
<h3><a name="Log" id="Log"></a>Viewing the Warning Log</h3>
<p>If <b>Policy Tool</b> ever reports that warnings have been
stored in the Warning Log, you can view the log by selecting the
<b>View Warning Log</b> command in the <b>File</b> menu.</p>
<p>For example, if you have a policy file with a Keystore URL
specifying a keystore that doesn't yet exist, you will get such a
warning at various times, e.g., when you open the file. You can
continue to work on the policy file even if warnings exist.</p>
<h2><a name="Examples" id="Examples"></a>Examples</h2>
<p>The following examples show how to</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#ExStartingCreation">create the user policy file</a>
from scratch</li>
<li><a href="#ExAddEntry">add a policy entry</a></li>
<li><a href="#ExSpecifyKeystore">specify a keystore</a></li>
<li><a href="#ExAddSignedByEntry">add a policy entry for signed
code</a></li>

authenticated code</a></li>
<li><a href="#ExSaveFile">save the user policy file</a>, and</li>
<li><a href="#ExExit">exit the Policy Tool</a></li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="ExStartingCreation" id="ExStartingCreation">Starting
Creation of the User Policy File</a></h3>
<p>Initially, there is no user policy file (unless you created one
manually). So to create the user policy file, first simply start
<b>Policy Tool</b> by typing the following at the command line.</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
  policytool
</pre>
<p>This brings up the "Policy Tool" window.</p>
<p>Whenever Policy Tool is started, it tries to fill in this window
with policy information from what is sometimes referred to as the
"user policy file". The user policy file is by default a file named
<code>.java.policy</code> in your home directory. If Policy Tool
cannot find the user policy file, it reports the situation and
displays a blank "Policy Tool" window (that is, a window with
headings and buttons but no data in it):</p>
<p><img src="images/ptBlank.gif" alt=
"Policy Tool window to create a user profile" /></p>
<p>You can now create the user policy file by adding entries and
saving the file.</p>
<h3><a name="ExAddEntry" id="ExAddEntry">Adding a Policy
Entry</a></h3>
<p>Suppose you want to grant all classes from the
<code>/tests/</code> directory permission to read the file named
<code>mydata</code> in the <code>/temp/data/</code> directory. To
do so, first select the <b>Add Policy Entry</b> button in the main
"Policy Tool" window.</p>
<p>This brings up a "Policy Entry" dialog box:</p>
<p><img src="images/AddEntryBlank.gif" alt=
"Polity Entry dialog to add a policy entry" /></p>
<p>Using this dialog box, type the file URL</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
  file:/tests/
</pre>
<p>into the <b>CodeBase</b> text box.</p>
<p>Leave the <b>SignedBy</b> text box blank, since you aren't
requiring the code to be signed.</p>
<p>Leave the <b>Principals</b> list blank, since you aren't
requiring the code to be authenticated.</p>
<p>To add the permission, select the <b>Add Permission</b> button.
This brings up the "Permissions" dialog box:</p>
<p><img src="images/AddPermBlank.gif" alt=
"Permissions dialog to add a new permissions" /></p>
<p>To add the permission:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select "File Permission" from the "Permission:" drop-down list.
The complete permission type name (java.io.FilePermission) now
appears in the text box to the right of the drop-down list.</li>
<li>Type the following in the text box to the right of the list
labeled "Target Name:":
<pre class="codeblock">
  /temp/data/mydata
</pre></li>
<li>Specify read access by either selecting "read" from the
"Actions:" drop-down list or directly typing "read" into the text
box to the right of the "Actions:" drop-down list.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now the "Permission" dialog box looks like the following:</p>
<p><img src="images/sAddFilePerm1.gif" alt=
"Permissions dialog showing the new permission to be added" /></p>
<p>When you are done specifying the permission information, select
the <b>OK</b> button. The new permission appears in a line in the
"Policy Entry" dialog.</p>
<p><img src="images/sAddEntry1.gif" alt="Permission shown in the Policy Entry dialog" /></p>
<p>You are now done specifying this policy entry, so select the
<b>Done</b> button. The "Policy Tool" window now contains a line
representing the policy entry. The line just contains the CodeBase
value:</p>
<p><img src="images/sptOneCB.gif" alt=
"Policy Tool window showing one CodeBase" /></p>
<h3><a name="ExSpecifyKeystore" id=
"ExSpecifyKeystore"></a>Specifying a Keystore</h3>
<p>Suppose you also want to grant any code from the URL
"http://example.com/" and signed by the alias "Signer" read access
to all files in the <code>/tmp/</code> directory. Suppose you also
want to give such code permission to initiate outgoing socket
connections to any hosts. You need to do two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Specify the keystore containing the alias, and</li>
<li><a href="#ExAddSignedByEntry">Create the policy entry</a>
granting the permissions.</li>
</ol>
<p>To specify the keystore containing the key information for the
aliases specified in any <b>SignedBy</b> parts of policy entries,
select the <b>Edit</b> command in the <b>Keystore</b> menu of the
main "Policy Tool" window.</p>
<p>This brings up a dialog box in which you specify the new
keystore URL and optionally the keystore type.</p>
<p>As an example, to specify the keystore named "mykeystore" in the
<code>/tests/</code> directory, type the following
<code>file:</code> URL into the text box labeled "New KeyStore
URL":</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
  file:/tests/mykeystore
</pre>
<p>If the keystore type is the default type, as specified by the
"keystore.type" property value in the security properties file, you
don't need to type a "New KeyStore Type" value. The default value
of that property is "JKS" (the proprietary keystore type supported
by Oracle).</p>
<p>To specify the keystore type, type its value into the text box
labeled "New KeyStore Type." For example, to indicate that the
keystore type is "JKS" type</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
  JKS
</pre>
<p>The result is:</p>
<p><img src="images/sAddKeystore.gif" alt="Keystore dialog to specify keystore type and URL" /></p>
<p>When you are done specifying the keystore URL and type, select
<b>OK</b>. The text box labeled "Keystore:" is now filled in with
the URL and type.</p>
<p>Next, you need to specify the policy entry:</p>
<h3><a name="ExAddSignedByEntry" id="ExAddSignedByEntry"></a>Adding
a Policy Entry with a SignedBy Alias</h3>
<p>Select the <b>Add Policy Entry</b> button in the main "Policy
Tool" window. This brings up the "Policy Entry" dialog box. Type
the following into the <b>CodeBase</b> text box:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
  http://example.com/*
</pre>
<p>The "*" indicates that both class and JAR files in the specified
directory are to be considered to match this <b>CodeBase</b>.</p>
<p>Now, type the following alias into the <b>SignedBy</b> text
box:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
  Signer
</pre>
<p>Leave the <b>Principals</b> list blank, since you aren't
requiring the code to be authenticated.</p>
<p>To add the first permission, select the <b>Add Permission</b>
button. This brings up the "Permissions" dialog box. Do the
following</p>
<ol>
<li>Select "File Permission" from the "Permission:" drop-down list.
The complete permission type name (java.io.FilePermission) now
appears in the text box to the right of the drop-down list.</li>
<li>Type the following in the text box to the right of the list
labeled "Target Name:" to specify all files in the
<code>/tmp/</code> directory:
<pre class="codeblock">
  /tmp/*
</pre></li>
<li>Specify read access by selecting "read" from the "Actions:"
drop-down list.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now the "Permissions" dialog box looks like the following:</p>
<p><img src="images/sAddFilePerm2.gif" alt=

</pre></li>
<li>Specify permission to make connections by selecting "connect"
from the "Actions:" drop-down list.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now the "Permissions" dialog box looks like the following:</p>
<p><img src="images/AddSocketPerm.gif" alt=

<p>Select the <b>OK</b> button. The new permission appears in a
line in the "Policy Entry" dialog.</p>
<p><img src="images/sAddEntry2.gif" alt=

<p>You are now done specifying this policy entry, so select the
<b>Done</b> button in the "Policy Entry" dialog. The "Policy Tool"
window now contains a line representing the policy entry, showing
the CodeBase, SignedBy and Principals values.</p>
<p><img src="images/sptTwoEntries.gif" alt=

</pre>
<p>permission to write to the <code>/tmp/</code> directory.</p>
<p>Select the <b>Add Policy Entry</b> button in the main "Policy
Tool" window. This brings up the "Policy Entry" dialog box.</p>
<p>Leave the <b>CodeBase</b> text box blank since you aren't
limiting where the code comes from.</p>
<p>Leave the <b>SignedBy</b> text box blank since you aren't
requiring the code to be signed.</p>
<p>Select the <b>Add Principal</b> button. In the "Principals"
dialog box, do the following</p>
<ol>
<li>Select "X500Principal" from the "Principal Type:" drop-down

</ol>
<p>Now the "Principals" dialog box looks like the following:</p>
<p><img src="images/AddX500Principal.gif" alt=
"Principals dialog to add a X500Principal" /></p>
<p>Select the <b>OK</b> button. The new principal appears in a line
