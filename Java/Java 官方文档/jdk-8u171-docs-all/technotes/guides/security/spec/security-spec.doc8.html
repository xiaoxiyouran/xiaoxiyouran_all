<h2><a name="a21605" id="a21605"><i>8</i> Discussion and Future
Directions</a></h2>
<br />
<h3><a name="a20670" id="a20670"><!-- --></a> <i>8.1</i> Resource
Consumption Management</h3>
<a name="a28214" id="a28214"><!-- --></a> Resource consumption
management is relatively easy to implement in some cases (e.g., to
limit the number of windows any application can pop up at any one
time), while it can be quite hard to implement efficiently in other
cases (e.g., to limit memory or file system usage). We plan to
coherently address such issues in the future.<br />
<h3><a name="a28250" id="a28250"><!-- --></a> <i>8.2</i> Arbitrary
Grouping of Permissions</h3>
<a name="a28251" id="a28251"><!-- --></a> Sometimes it is
convenient to group a number of permissions together and use a
short-hand name to refer to them. For example, if we would like to
have a permission called &#34;SuperPermission&#34; to include (and
imply) both FilePermission(&#34;-&#34;, &#34;read,write&#34;) and
SocketPermission(&#34;*&#34;, &#34;connect,accept&#34;),
technically we can use the class Permissions or a similar class to
implement this super permission by using the <code>add</code>
methods to add the required permissions. And such grouping can be
arbitrarily complicated.
<p><a name="a28252" id="a28252"><!-- --></a> The more difficult
issues are the following. First, to understand what actual
permissions one is granting when giving out such a super
permission, either a fixed and named permission class is created to
denote a statically specified group of permissions, or the member
permissions need to be spelled out in the policy file. Second,
processing the policy (file) can become more complicated because
the grouped permissions may need to be expanded. Moreover, nesting
of grouped permission increases complexity even more.</p>
<br />
<h3><a name="a28253" id="a28253"><!-- --></a> <i>8.3</i>
Object-Level Protection</h3>
<a name="a28254" id="a28254"><!-- --></a> Given the object-oriented
nature of the Java programming language, it is conceivable that
developers will benefit from a set of appropriate object-level
protection mechanisms that (1) goes beyond the natural protection
provided by the Java programming language and that (2) supplements
the thread-based access control mechanism.
<p><a name="a28255" id="a28255"><!-- --></a> One such mechanism is
SignedObject. Parallel to this primitive, we will provide
SealedObject that uses encryption to hide the content of an object.
(Due to current U.S. export control regulations on the use of
encryption, the SealedObject class will likely be provided separate
from the SDK.)</p>
<p><a name="a28256" id="a28256"><!-- --></a> GuardedObject is a
general way to enforce access control at a per class/object per
method level. This method, however, should be used only
selectively, partly because this type of control can be difficult
to administer at a high level.</p>
<br />
<h3><a name="a28269" id="a28269"><!-- --></a> <i>8.4</i>
Subdividing Protection Domains</h3>
<a name="a28270" id="a28270"><!-- --></a> A potentially useful
concept not currently implemented is that of &#34;subdomains.&#34;
A subdomain is one that is enclosed in another. A subdomain would
not have more permissions or privileges than the domain of which it
is a subpart. A domain could be created, for example, to
selectively further limit what a program can do.
<p><a name="a28271" id="a28271"><!-- --></a> Often a domain is
thought of as supporting inheritance: a subdomain would
automatically inherit the parent domain&#39;s security attributes,
except in certain cases where the parent further restricts the
subdomain explicitly. Relaxing a subdomain by right amplification
is a possibility with the notion of trusted code.</p>
<p><a name="a28272" id="a28272"><!-- --></a> For convenience, we
can think of the system domain as a single, big collection of all
system code. For better protection, though, system code should be
run in multiple system domains, where each domain protects a
particular type of resource and is given a special set of rights.
For example, if file system code and network system code run in
separate domains, where the former has no rights to the networking
resources and the latter has no rights to the file system
resources, the risks and consequence of an error or security flaw
in one system domain is more likely to be confined within its
boundary.</p>
<br />
<h3><a name="a28211" id="a28211"><!-- --></a> <i>8.5</i> Running
Applets with Signed Content</h3>
<a name="a20671" id="a20671"><!-- --></a> The JAR and Manifest
specifications on code signing allow a very flexible format.
Classes within the same archive can be signed with different keys,
and a class can be unsigned, signed with one key, or signed with
multiple keys. Other resources within the archive, such as audio
clips and graphic images, can also be signed or unsigned, just like
classes can.
<p><a name="a20672" id="a20672"><!-- --></a> This flexibility
brings about the issue of interpretation. The following questions
need to be answered, especially when keys are treated
differently:</p>
<pre>
1. Should images and audios be required to be signed with the
   same key if any class in the archive is signed?
2. If images and audios are signed with different keys, can
   they be placed in the same appletviewer (or browser page),
   or should they be sent to different viewers for processing?
</pre>
<a name="a20679" id="a20679"><!-- --></a> These questions are not
easy to answer, and require consistency across platforms and
products to be the most effective. Our intermediate approach is to
provide a simple answer -- all images and audio clips are forwarded
to be processed within the same applet classloader, whether they
are signed or not. This temporary solution will be improved once a
consensus is reached.
<p><a name="a22305" id="a22305"><!-- --></a> Moreover, if a digital
signature cannot be verified because the bytecode content of a
class file does not match the signed hash value in the JAR, a
security exception is thrown, as the original intention of the JAR
author is clearly altered. Previously, there was a suggestion to
run such code as untrusted. This idea is undesirable because the
applet classloader allows the loading of code signed by multiple
parties. This means that accepting a partially modified JAR file
would allow an untrusted piece of code to run together with and
access other code through the same classloader.</p>
