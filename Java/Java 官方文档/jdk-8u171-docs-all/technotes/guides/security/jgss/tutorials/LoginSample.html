<h1>Use of JAAS Login Utility</h1>

<br />
<br />
<p>The previous two tutorials, <a href="AcnOnly.html">JAAS
Authentication</a> and <a href="AcnAndAzn.html">JAAS
Authorization</a>, show how you can use the LoginContext and
Subject classes to write a program to</p>
<ul>
<li>authenticate the user to verify his or her identity and</li>
<li>associate an instance of a particular class representing the
user (a Subject instance) with an access control context in such a
way that subsequent security-sensitive operations will be allowed
if the current policy grants the user the required
permissions.</li>
</ul>
<p>This tutorial describes a Login utility that performs the above
operations and then executes any specified application as the
authenticated user.</p>
<p>Use of the Login utility with a sample application is
demonstrated in this tutorial. The <a href="ClientServer.html">next
tutorial</a>, a client/server application using the Java GSS-API,
also uses the Login utility.</p>
<p>It is not necessary to read the previous two tutorials on JAAS
authentication and authorization prior to reading this one.
However, you may want to refer to some sections in those tutorials
to obtain further details regarding certain topics, such as
<a href="AcnAndAzn.html#UserPFStmts">how to make user-based policy
file statements</a>. You should also read <a href=
"LoginConfigFile.html">JAAS Login Configuration File</a> for
information as to what a login configuration file is, since one is
needed for this and all other tutorials in this series.</p>
<p>As with all tutorials in this series of tutorials, the
underlying technology used to support authentication is Kerberos.
See <a href="KerberosReq.html">Kerberos Requirements</a>.</p>

<h2>What You Need to Know About the Login Utility</h2>
<p>You do not need to understand the code contained in <a href=
"Login.java">Login.java</a>; you can just use it as is. However,
you need to understand some facts about what it does so that your
program, policy file, and login configuration file will properly
work with it. Below is a summary of these facts, followed by
sections with further information and examples.</p>
<p>The Login class does the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assumes it is passed, as arguments, your application's
top-level class name, followed by any arguments your application
may require.</li>
<li>Assumes that the class name of your top-level application class
is also used as the name of the entry to be looked up in your login
configuration file.</li>
<li>Specifies the TextCallbackHandler class (from the
<code>com.sun.security.auth.callback</code> package) as the class
to be used when communicating with the user. This class can prompt
the user for a user name and password.</li>
<li>Uses a LoginContext to authenticate the user. The LoginContext
invokes the appropriate authentication technology, or LoginModule,
to perform the authentication. LoginModules use a CallbackHandler
(in our case, TextCallbackHandler) as needed to communicate with
the user.</li>
<li>Allows the user three attempts to successfully log in.</li>
<li>Creates an instance of the MyAction class (also in
<code>Login.java</code>), passing it the application arguments, if
any.</li>
<li>Invokes <code>Subject.doAsPrivileged</code>, passing it a
Subject representing the user, the MyAction instance, and a null
AccessControlContext. The result is that the public static main
method from your application is invoked and your application code
is considered to be executed on behalf of the user.</li>
</ul>
<a name="LMProgReqs" id="LMProgReqs"></a>
<h2>Application and Other File Requirements</h2>
<p>To utilize the Login utility to authenticate the user and
execute your application, you may need a small number of additions
or modifications to your login configuration file and policy file,
as described in the following.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#AppReqs">Application Requirements</a></li>
<li><a href="#LCFReqs">Login Configuration File
Requirements</a></li>
<li><a href="#PFReqs">Policy File Requirements</a></li>
</ul>
<a name="AppReqs" id="AppReqs"></a>
<h3>Application Requirements</h3>
<p>In order to utilize the Login utility, your application code
does not need anything special. All you need is for the entry point
of your application to be the <code>main</code> method of a class
you write, as usual.</p>
<p>The way to invoke Login such that it will authenticate the user
and then instantiate MyAction to invoke your application is the
following:</p>
<pre>
java &lt;options&gt; Login &lt;AppName&gt; &lt;app arguments&gt; 
</pre>
where &lt;AppName&gt; is your application's top-level class name
and &lt;app arguments&gt; are any arguments required by your
application. See <a href="#RunSample">Running the Sample Program
with the Login Utility</a> for the full command used for this
tutorial. <a name="LCFReqs" id="LCFReqs"></a>
<h3>Login Configuration File Requirements</h3>
<p>Whenever a LoginContext is used to authenticate the user, you
need a login configuration file to specify the desired login
module. See the <a href="AcnOnly.html#ConfigFile">The Login
Configuration File</a> section in the JAAS authentication tutorial
for more information as to what a login configuration file is and
what it contains.</p>
<p>When you use the Login utility, the name for the login
configuration file entry must be exactly the same as your top-level
application class name. See <a href="#LCF">The Login Configuration
File</a> in this tutorial for an example.</p>
<a name="PFReqs" id="PFReqs"></a>
<h3>Policy File Requirements</h3>
<p>Whenever you run an application with a security manager, you
need a policy indicating the permissions granted to specific code,
or to specific code being executed by a specific user (or users).
One way of specifying the policy is by <code>grant</code>
statements in a policy file. See <a href="#PF">The Policy File</a>
for more information.</p>
<p>If you use the Login utility to invoke your application, then
you will need to grant it various permissions, as described in
<a href="#LMAPerms">Permissions Required by the Login and MyAction
Classes</a>.</p>
<a name="SampleProg" id="SampleProg"></a>
<h2>The Sample Application Program</h2>
The <a href="Sample.java">Sample.java</a> application used for this
tutorial performs the same actions as the
<code>SampleAction.java</code> application did in the previous
(<a href="AcnAndAzn.html">JAAS Authorization</a>) tutorial. It does
the following:
<ul>
<li>Reads and prints the value of the <code>java.home</code> system
property,</li>
<li>Reads and prints the value of the <code>user.home</code> system
property, and</li>
<li>Determines whether or not a file named <code>foo.txt</code>
exists in the current directory.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is the code:</p>
<pre>
import java.io.File;

public class Sample {

  public static void main (String[] args) throws SecurityException {

    // If there were any arguments to read, we'd do it here.

    System.out.println("\nYour java.home property value is: "
                +System.getProperty("java.home"));

    System.out.println("\nYour user.home property value is: "
                +System.getProperty("user.home"));

    File f = new File("foo.txt");
    System.out.print("\nfoo.txt does ");
    if (!f.exists())
        System.out.print("not ");
    System.out.println("exist in the current working directory.");
  }
}
</pre>
<a name="LCF" id="LCF"></a>
<h2>The Login Configuration File</h2>
<p>The <a href="sample.conf">sample.conf</a> login configuration
file for this tutorial contains a single entry, just like the login
configuration file for the previous (<a href="AcnAndAzn.html">JAAS
Authorization</a>) tutorial. The entry contents are the same since
the class implementing the desired authentication technology in
both cases is the Krb5LoginModule in the
<code>com.sun.security.auth.module</code> package.</p>
<p>The only difference is the name used for the entry. In the
previous tutorial we used the name "JaasSample", since that is the
name used by the JaasAzn class to look up the entry. When you use
the Login utility with your application, it expects the name for
your login configuration file entry to be the same as the name of
your top-level application class. That application class for this
tutorial is named "Sample" so that must also be the name of the
login configuration file entry. Thus the login configuration file
looks like the following:</p>
<pre>
Sample {
   com.sun.security.auth.module.Krb5LoginModule required;
};
</pre>
<p>The "required" indicates that login using the Krb5LoginModule is
required to "succeed" in order for authentication to be considered
successful. The Krb5LoginModule succeeds only if the name and
password supplied by the user are successfully used to log the user
into the Kerberos KDC.</p>
<p>For information about all the possible options that can be
passed to Krb5LoginModule, see the <a href=
"../../../../../jre/api/security/jaas/spec/com/sun/security/auth/module/Krb5LoginModule.html">
Krb5LoginModule documentation</a>.</p>
<a name="PF" id="PF"></a>
<h2>The Policy File</h2>
<p>The Login, MyAction, and Sample classes all perform some
security-sensitive operations and thus relevant permissions are
required in a policy file in order for the operations to be
executed. <a name="LMAPerms" id="LMAPerms"></a></p>
<h3>Permissions Required by the Login and MyAction Classes</h3>
<p>For this tutorial, you will create a <code>Login.jar</code> JAR
file containing the <code>Login.class</code> and
<code>MyAction.class</code> files. You need to grant
<code>Login.jar</code> various permissions, specifically the ones
required for invoking the security-sensitive methods the
<code>Login.jar</code> classes call, as well as all the permissions
required by your application. Otherwise, access control checks will
fail.</p>
<p>The simplest thing to do, and what we recommend, is to grant
<code>Login.jar AllPermission</code>. For this tutorial, the
<code>Login.jar</code> file is assumed to be in the current
directory and the policy file includes the following:</p>
<pre>
grant codebase "file:./Login.jar" {
   permission java.security.AllPermission;
};
</pre>
<h3>Permissions Required by Sample</h3>
<p>(Note: This section is essentially a modified copy of the
<a href="AcnAndAzn.html#AznPF">Permissions Required by
SampleAction</a> section from the previous (<a href=
"AcnAndAzn.html">JAAS Authorization</a>) tutorial, since Sample and
SampleAction perform the same operations and thus require the same
permissions.)</p>
<p>The <code>Sample</code> code does three operations for which
permissions are required. It</p>
<ul>
<li>reads the value of the "java.home" system property.</li>
<li>reads the value of the "user.home" system property.</li>
<li>checks to see whether or not a file named <code>foo.txt</code>
exists in the current directory.</li>
</ul>
<p>The permissions required for these operations are the
following:</p>
<pre>
permission java.util.PropertyPermission "java.home", "read";
permission java.util.PropertyPermission "user.home", "read";
permission java.io.FilePermission "foo.txt", "read";
</pre>
<p>We need to grant these permissions to the code in
<code>Sample.class</code>, which we will place in a JAR file named
<code>Sample.jar</code>. However, our <code>grant</code> statement
will grant the permissions not just to the <i>code</i> but to a
specific authenticated user executing the code. This illustrates
how you can use a Principal designation in a <code>grant</code>
statement to restrict execution of security-sensitive operations in
code to a specific user rather than allowing the permissions to all
users executing the code.</p>
<p>Thus, as explained in <a href="AcnAndAzn.html#UserPFStmts">How
Do You Make Principal-Based Policy File Statements?</a>, our
<code>grant</code> statement looks like the following:</p>
<pre>
grant codebase "file:./Sample.jar",
    Principal javax.security.auth.kerberos.KerberosPrincipal 
        "your_user_name@your_realm"  {

   permission java.util.PropertyPermission "java.home", "read";
   permission java.util.PropertyPermission "user.home", "read";
   permission java.io.FilePermission "foo.txt", "read";
};
</pre>
<b>Important: You must substitute your Kerberos user name (complete
with "@" and realm) for
"<code>your_user_name@your_realm</code>".</b> For example, if your
user name is "mjones" and your realm is "KRBNT-OPERATIONS.ABC.COM",
you would use "mjones@KRBNT-OPERATIONS.ABC.COM" (complete with the
quotes).
<h3>The Full Policy File</h3>
<p>The full policy file is <a href=
"sample.policy">sample.policy</a>.</p>
<a name="RunSample" id="RunSample"></a>
<h2>Running the Sample Program with the Login Utility</h2>
<p>To execute the Sample application with the Login utility, do the
following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Place the following files into a directory:
<ul>
<li>The <a href="Login.java">Login.java</a> source file.</li>
<li>The <a href="Sample.java">Sample.java</a> source file.</li>
<li>The <a href="sample.conf">sample.conf</a> login configuration
file.</li>
<li>The <a href="sample.policy">sample.policy</a> policy file.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Replace "your_user_name@your_realm" in
<code>sample.policy</code> with your user name and realm.</li>
<li>Compile <code>Login.java</code> and <code>Sample.java</code>:
<pre>
javac Login.java Sample.java
</pre>
<p>Note that <code>Login.java</code> contains two classes and thus
compiling <code>Login.java</code> creates <code>Login.class</code>
and <code>MyAction.class</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>Create a JAR file named <code>Login.jar</code> containing
<code>Login.class and MyAction.class</code>:
<pre>
jar -cvf Login.jar Login.class MyAction.class
</pre></li>
<li>Create a JAR file named <code>Sample.jar</code> containing
<code>Sample.class</code>:
<pre>
jar -cvf Sample.jar Sample.class
</pre></li>
<li>Execute the <code>Login</code> class, specifying
<ul>
<li>by an appropriate <code>-classpath</code> clause that classes
should be searched for in the <code>Login.jar</code> and
<code>Sample.jar</code> JAR files,</li>
<li>by <code>-Djava.security.manager</code> that a security manager
should be installed,</li>
<li>by <code>-Djava.security.krb5.realm=&lt;your_realm&gt;</code>
that your Kerberos realm is the one specified.</li>
<li>by <code>-Djava.security.krb5.kdc=&lt;your_kdc&gt;</code> that
your Kerberos KDC is the one specified.</li>
<li>by <code>-Djava.security.policy=sample.policy</code> that the
policy file to be used is <code>sample.policy</code>, and</li>
<li>by <code>-Djava.security.auth.login.config=sample.conf</code>
that the login configuration file to be used is
<code>sample.conf</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You pass the name of your application (in this case, "Sample")
as an argument to Login. You would then add as arguments any
arguments required by your application, but in our case Sample does
not require any.</p>
<p>Below are the full commands to use for both Microsoft Windows
and Solaris, Linux, and Mac OS X systems. The only difference is
that on Windows systems
you use semicolons to separate classpath items, while you use
colons for that purpose on Solaris, Linux, and Mac OS X systems.
<b>Be sure to replace
<code>&lt;your_realm&gt;</code> with your Kerberos realm, and
<code>&lt;your_kdc&gt;</code> with your Kerberos KDC.</b></p>
<p>Here is the full command for Windows systems:</p>
<pre>
java -classpath Login.jar;Sample.jar 
 -Djava.security.manager 
 -Djava.security.krb5.realm=&lt;your_realm&gt; 
 -Djava.security.krb5.kdc=&lt;your_kdc&gt; 
 -Djava.security.policy=sample.policy 
 -Djava.security.auth.login.config=sample.conf Login Sample
</pre>
<p>Here is the full command for Solaris, Linux, and Mac OS X systems:</p>
<pre>
java -classpath Login.jar:Sample.jar 
 -Djava.security.manager 
 -Djava.security.krb5.realm=&lt;your_realm&gt; 
 -Djava.security.krb5.kdc=&lt;your_kdc&gt; 
 -Djava.security.policy=sample.policy 
 -Djava.security.auth.login.config=sample.conf Login Sample
</pre>
<p>Type the full command on one line. Multiple lines are used here
for legibility. If the command is too long for your system, you may
need to place it in a .bat file (for Windows) or a .sh file (for
Solaris, Linux, and Mac OS X) and then run that file to execute
the command.</p>
<p>You will be prompted for your Kerberos user name and password,
and the underlying Kerberos login module specified in the login
configuration file will log you into Kerberos. Once authentication
is successfully completed, the <code>Sample</code> code will be
executed on behalf of you, the user. The <code>sample.policy</code>
policy file grants you the required permissions, so you will see a
display of the values of your <code>java.home</code> and
<code>user.home</code> system properties and a statement as to
whether or not you have a file named <code>foo.txt</code> in the
current directory.</p>
