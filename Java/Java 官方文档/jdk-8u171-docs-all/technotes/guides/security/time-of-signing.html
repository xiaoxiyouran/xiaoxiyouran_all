<h1>Signature Timestamp Support</h1>
<h2><a name="INTRO" id="INTRO">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>This document describes the enhancements that have been added in
Java SE 5.0 to support signature timestamps. </p>
<p>Prior to Java SE 5.0, the signature generated by <code>jarsigner</code> contained no information about when the signature was generated. With no other information available, systems/deployers (including users of the Java Plug-in) often based their validity assessment of a signed JAR file on the validity of the signing certificate. When the signing certificate expires,
systems/deployers conclude that the signature, and hence, the JAR file, has expired. Because signing certificates typically expire annually, this caused customers significant problems by forcing them to re-sign deployed JAR files annually.</p>
<p>Starting in Java SE 5.0, <code>jarsigner</code> can generate
signatures that include a timestamp, thus enabling systems/deployer
(including Java Plug-in) to check whether the JAR file was signed
while the signing certificate was still valid. In addition, APIs
were added in Java SE 5.0 to allow applications to obtain the timestamp information.</p>
<p>The following time-of-signing enhancements and additions are
supported in version 5.0 of the JavaSE platform:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#JARSIGNER">Jarsigner Enhancements</a></li>
<li><a href="#JAVAPLUGIN">Java Plug-in Enhancements</a></li>
<li><a href="#APIENHANCE">API Enhancements</a></li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="JARSIGNER" id="JARSIGNER">Jarsigner
Enhancements</a></h2>
The <code>jarsigner</code> tool can now generate and store a
signature timestamp when signing a JAR file. In addition,
<code>jarsigner</code> supports alternative signing mechanisms.
This behavior is optional and is controlled by the user at the time
of signing through the options described below.
<h3>Jarsigner Timestamp Options</h3>
<p>The following options were added to the <code>jarsigner</code> tool
to support signature timestamps:</p>
<p><code>-tsa url</code></p>
<p>If <code>"-tsa http://example.tsa.url"</code> appears on the
command line when signing a JAR file then a timestamp is generated
for the signature. The URL, <code>http://example.tsa.url</code>,
identifies the location of the Time Stamping Authority (TSA). It
overrides any URL found via the <code>-tsacert</code> option. The
<code>-tsa</code> option does not require the TSA's public key
certificate to be present in the keystore.</p>
<p>To generate the timestamp, <code>jarsigner</code> communicates
with the TSA using the Time-Stamp Protocol (TSP) defined in
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3161.txt">RFC 3161</a>. If
successful, the timestamp token returned by the TSA is stored along
with the signature in the signature block file.</p>
<p><code>-tsacert alias</code></p>
If <code>"-tsacert alias"</code> appears on the command line when
signing a JAR file then a timestamp is generated for the signature.
The <code>alias</code> identifies the TSA's public key certificate
in the keystore that is currently in effect. The entry's
certificate is examined for a Subject Information Access extension
that contains a URL identifying the location of the TSA.
<p>The TSA's public key certificate must be present in the keystore
when using <code>-tsacert</code>.</p>
<h3>Alternative Signing Options</h3>
<h4>Specifying an Alternative Signing Mechanism</h4>
<code>-altsigner class</code> Specifies that an alternative signing
mechanism be used. The fully-qualified class name identifies a
class file that extends the <code>com.sun.jarsigner.ContentSigner
abstract class</code>. The path to this class file is defined by
the <code>-altsignerpath</code> option. If the
<code>-altsigner</code> option is used, <code>jarsigner</code> uses
the signing mechanism provided by the specified class. Otherwise,
<code>jarsigner</code> uses its default signing mechanism.
<p>For example, to use the signing mechanism provided by a class
named <code>com.sun.sun.jarsigner.AuthSigner</code>, use the
<code>jarsigner</code> option <code>"-altsigner
com.sun.jarsigner.AuthSigner"</code></p>
<h4>Specifying Path to Alternative Signing Mechanism</h4>
<code>-altsignerpath classpathlist</code> Specifies the path to the
class file (the class file name is specified with the
<code>-altsigner</code> option described above) and any JAR files
it depends on. If the class file is in a JAR file, then this
specifies the path to that JAR file, as shown in the example below.
<p>An absolute path or a path relative to the current directory may
be specified. If <code>classpathlist</code> contains multiple paths
or JAR files, they should be separated with a colon
(<code>:</code>) on Solaris and a semi-colon (<code>;</code>) on
Windows. This option is not necessary if the class is already in
the search path.</p>
<p>Example of specifying the path to a jar file that contains the
class file:</p>
<p><code>-altsignerpath /home/user/lib/authsigner.jar</code></p>
<p>Note that the JAR file name is included.</p>
<p>Example of specifying the path to the jar file that contains the
class file:</p>
<p><code>-altsignerpath
/home/user/classes/com/sun/tools/jarsigner/</code></p>
<p>Note that the JAR file name is omitted.</p>
<h2><a name="JAVAPLUGIN" id="JAVAPLUGIN">Java Plug-in Enhancements</a></h2>
<p>In Java SE 5.0, the Java Plug-in was enhanced to check signature
timestamps (if available) when validating JAR files. The Java
Plug-in will no longer present a dialog when it encounters an
expired or revoked certificate when validating a signed jar,
provided that the signature timestamp confirms that the signature
was generated prior to the expiration or revocation date.</p>
<p>The TSA's certificate must be available from the Plug-in's
keystore or certificate stores when the Plug-in is validating a JAR
file containing a signature timestamp.</p>
<p>The Plugin reverts to 1.4.x behavior if the signature does not
contain a timestamp.</p>
<h2><a name="APIENHANCE" id="APIENHANCE">API Enhancements</a></h2>
The security and JAR APIs were enhanced to enable applications to
access timestamp information.
<p>Two new classes were added to the <tt>java.security</tt>
package. These classes are <a href=
"../../../api/java/security/CodeSigner.html">CodeSigner</a>, which
maintains information associated with a signer, and <a href=
"../../../api/java/security/Timestamp.html">Timestamp</a>, which
represents information associated with a signature timestamp.</p>
<p>New methods were added to the <tt><a href=
"../../../api/java/security/CodeSource.html#getCodeSigners--">java.security.CodeSource</a></tt>
class and <tt><a href=
"../../../api/java/util/jar/JarEntry.html#getCodeSigners--">java.util.jar.JarEntry</a></tt>
class to allow access to this new, optional information.</p>
