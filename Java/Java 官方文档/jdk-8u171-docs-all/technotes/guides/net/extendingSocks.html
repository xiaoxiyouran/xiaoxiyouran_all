<h2>Extending Sockets in JDK 1.1</h2>
<p>Some of the improvements to the <code>java.net</code> classes in
JDK 1.1 allow sockets (Socket/ServerSocket) to be non-final,
extendable classes. The basic goal is to allow extended sockets to
be used whereever a base class Socket is used without rewriting
application code. So for example an already-existing email client
could be handed a subclass of Socket that does peer authentication
or encryption, which the Socket subclass would handle
transparently. Other examples include sockets that transparently
use compression, or which add functionality such as mirroring
traffic to multiple servers (e.g. using reliable ordered
multicast).</p>

<h2><a name="SocketImpl" id="SocketImpl">JDK 1.0: SocketImpl and
SocketImplFactory</a></h2>
<p>JDK 1.0 allows licensees to extend socket functionality in one
very particular way: they can subclass
<code>java.net.SocketImpl</code> , and provide an enhanced
java.net.SocketImplFactory() which returns such classes as
needed.</p>
<p>The SocketImpl/SocketImplFactory scheme is useful for, and was
designed for, java apps/applications to be portable across
environments that use different transport mechanisms. A client
application that uses a java.net.Socket can work in the general
case (where the runtime uses a PlainSocketImpl), as well as in
environments where network connections must do something
particular. For example, a java program should be able to work
behind a firewall where connections to the Internet must be done
through a proxy protocol, like <a href=
"http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1928.txt">SOCKS</a>, assuming the right
kind of SocketImpl is set for the java runtime in that
environment.</p>
<p>Though the SocketImpl is useful for things like transparently
providing proxy support to java apps, its utility is limited as a
way to provide added functionality of network transport, or for
layering other protocols on top of TCP. Additionally, it's only
possible to have a single type of SocketImpl installed for a java
runtime, which limits large-scale applications. It's cleaner and
more intuitive to make ServerSocket and Socket extendable.</p>
<p>Note that the SocketImpl mechanism is designed to be orthogonal
to the functionality provided by a subclass of Socket: for example,
a subclass of Socket that is capable of doing compression on its
streams would still want to use the system-default SocketImpl to
get proxy support behind certain kinds of firewalls. The
system-default SocketImpl can be thought of as an extension of the
transport layer that applications needn't be aware of, and
subclasses of Socket/ServerSocket provide richer functionality at
the application layer.</p>

<h2>Change in JDK 1.1</h2>
<p>In JDK 1.1, Socket and ServerSocket are made non-final, which is
a pretty simple change. The one basic caveat is that subclasses do
not have direct access to the underlying SocketImpl in the base
classes, primarily for security reasons. But other than that,
subclasses of Socket/ServerSocket inherit and can override methods
from their superclass.</p>
<p>The JDK changed by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Removing the <code>final</code> modifier from the
<code>Socket</code> and <code>ServerSocket</code> classes.</li>
<li>Reattaching that <code>final</code> modifier only to methods
where it is needed to avoid bypassing security manager calls.</li>
<li>Defining a new method in ServerSocket with signature:
<code>protected final void implAccept(Socket client)</code> to use
when initializing a newly accepted socket.</li>
<li>Exposing a default <code>Socket</code> constructor so that
Socket subclasses could initialize their superclass without doing
an actual connection in the superclass. This is also required so
that a ServerSocket subclasses can return the correct Socket
subclass from accept() (e.g., FooServerSocket.accept() returns a
FooSocket)</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="Socket" id="Socket"></a></h2>
<hr width="50%" />
<h2>Changes to Socket</h2>
<p>The public constructors to Socket of the general form:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
        Socket(String host, int port) {
          ...
        }
</pre>
<p>can be used by subclasses to initialize the superclass, but they
will also create a system-default SocketImpl and connect it to the
specified host, port. Socket also has two protected constructors to
initialize the superclass without connecting the Socket:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
        protected Socket() {
          /* install system-default SocketImpl */
          ...
        }

        protected Socket(SocketImpl impl) {
          this.impl = impl;
        }
</pre>
<p>The first constructor installs a system-default SocketImpl (either
from the factory or a PlainSocketImpl). The second allows for a
subclass of Socket to install its own impl if need be. If the
Socket subclass doesn't need the default SocketImpl, it's perfectly
valid to use the second constructor and pass it null. (But in this
case the subclass should of course override <b>all</b> the base
class methods, since they all rely on the underlying SocketImpl).</p>
<!-- *********************************************************** -->
<h2><a name="ServerSocket" id="ServerSocket"></a></h2>
<hr width="50%" />
<h2>Changes to ServerSocket</h2>
<p>Subclasses of ServerSocket also have a protected constructor
exposed to them that creates a default SocketImpl in the base
class, but doesn't otherwise initialize it (e.g., doesn't call
impl.create(), impl.bind() or impl.listen()). The public
constructors of ServerSocket <b>will</b> initialize the underlying
SocketImpl.</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
        protected ServerSocket() {
          /* install system-default SocketImpl */
          ...
        }
</pre>
<p>The only other thing about extending ServerSocket that should be
explained is how to override accept() when the underlying
SocketImpl for Socket/ServerSocket isn't accesible to subclasses.
Since the base class <i>can</i> do this, ServerSocket has a method
to make the necessary calls on the underlying SocketImpl's on
behalf of subclasses:</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
public class ServerSocket {
        ...
        protected final void implAccept(Socket s) throws IOException {
           ...
           // on return from this call s will be connected to a client
        }
        ...
</pre>
<p>Note that subclasses of Socket/ServerSocket that don't use a
SocketImpl needn't use this method. As an example of how this
works, here's what some SSL code might look like.</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
<code>
class SSLServerSocket extends ServerSocket {
    ...
    public Socket accept () throws IOException
    {
        SSLSocket s = new SSLSocket (certChain, privateKey);
        // create an unconnected client SSLSocket, that we'll
        // return from accept

        implAccept (s);
        s.handshake ();
        return s;
    }
    ...
}

class SSLSocket extends java.net.Socket {
    ...
    public SSLSocket(CertChain c, PrivateKey k) {
        super();
        ...
    }
    ...
}
</code>
</pre>
