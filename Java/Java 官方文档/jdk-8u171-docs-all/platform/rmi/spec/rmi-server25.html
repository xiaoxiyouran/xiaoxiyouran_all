<h2><a name="a179" id="a179"><i>5.4</i> The
<code>Unreferenced</code> Interface</a></h2>
<pre class="codeblock">
package java.rmi.server;

public interface Unreferenced {
        public void unreferenced();
}


</pre>
<a name="a1584" id="a1584"><!-- --></a> The
<code>java.rmi.server.Unreferenced</code> interface allows a server
object to receive notification that there are no clients holding
remote references to it. The distributed garbage collection
mechanism maintains for each remote object, the set of client
virtual machines that hold references to that remote object. As
long as some client holds a remote reference to the remote object,
the RMI runtime keeps a local reference to the remote object. Each
time the remote object&#39;s &#34;reference&#34; set becomes empty
(meaning that the number of clients that reference the object
becomes zero), the <code>Unreferenced.unreferenced</code> method is
invoked (if that remote object implements the
<code>Unreferenced</code> interface). A remote object is
<em>not</em> required to support the <code>Unreferenced</code>
interface.
<p><a name="a1593" id="a1593"><!-- --></a> As long as some local
reference to the remote object exists, it may be passed in remote
calls or returned to clients. The process that receives the
reference is added to the reference set for the remote object. When
the reference set becomes empty, the remote object&#39;s
<code>unreferenced</code> method will be invoked. As such, the
<code>unreferenced</code> method can be called more than once (each
time the set is newly emptied). Remote objects are only collected
when no more references, either local references or those held by
clients, still exist.</p>
