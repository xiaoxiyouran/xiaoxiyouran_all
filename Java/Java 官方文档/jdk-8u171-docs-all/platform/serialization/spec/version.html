<h2><a name="a8130" id="a8130"><i>5.1</i> Overview</a></h2>
<a name="a5722" id="a5722"><!-- --></a> When Java objects use
serialization to save state in files, or as blobs in databases, the
potential arises that the version of a class reading the data is
different than the version that wrote the data.
<p><a name="a5708" id="a5708"><!-- --></a> Versioning raises some
fundamental questions about the identity of a class, including what
constitutes a compatible change. A <i><b>compatible change</b></i>
is a change that does not affect the contract between the class and
its callers.</p>
<p><a name="a5698" id="a5698"><!-- --></a> This section describes
the goals, assumptions, and a solution that attempts to address
this problem by restricting the kinds of changes allowed and by
carefully choosing the mechanisms.</p>
<p><a name="a7258" id="a7258"><!-- --></a></p>
<p>The proposed solution provides a mechanism for
&#34;automatic&#34; handling of classes that evolve by adding
fields and adding classes. Serialization will handle versioning
without class-specific methods to be implemented for each version.
The stream format can be traversed without invoking class-specific
methods.</p>
<hr size="8" width="35%" align="left" noshade="noshade" />
<h2><a name="a4569" id="a4569"><i>5.2</i> Goals</a></h2>
<a name="a4570" id="a4570"><!-- --></a>
<p>The goals are to:</p>
<ul>
<li><a name="a9359" id="a9359"><!-- --></a> Support bidirectional
communication between different versions of a class operating in
different virtual machines by:
<ul>
<li>Defining a mechanism that allows Java classes to read streams
written by older versions of the same class.</li>
<li><a name="a4581" id="a4581"><!-- --></a>Defining a mechanism
that allows Java classes to write streams intended to be read by
older versions of the same class.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a name="a7270" id="a7270"><!-- --></a> Provide default
serialization for persistence and for RMI.</li>
<li><a name="a4579" id="a4579"><!-- --></a> Perform well and
produce compact streams in simple cases, so that RMI can use
serialization.</li>
<li><a name="a4584" id="a4584"><!-- --></a> Be able to identify and
load classes that match the exact class used to write the
stream.</li>
<li><a name="a4585" id="a4585"><!-- --></a> Keep the overhead low
for nonversioned classes.</li>
<li><a name="a4832" id="a4832"><!-- --></a> Use a stream format
that allows the traversal of the stream without having to invoke
methods specific to the objects saved in the stream.</li>
</ul>
<hr size="8" width="35%" align="left" noshade="noshade" />
<h2><a name="a4595" id="a4595"><i>5.3</i> Assumptions</a></h2>
<a name="a9369" id="a9369"><!-- --></a>
<p>The assumptions are that:</p>
<ul>
<li><a name="a4596" id="a4596"><!-- --></a> Versioning will only
apply to serializable classes since it must control the stream
format to achieve it goals. Externalizable classes will be
responsible for their own versioning which is tied to the external
format.</li>
<li><a name="a8204" id="a8204"><!-- --></a> All data and objects
must be read from, or skipped in, the stream in the same order as
they were written.</li>
<li><a name="a4597" id="a4597"><!-- --></a> Classes evolve
individually as well as in concert with supertypes and
subtypes.</li>
<li><a name="a4601" id="a4601"><!-- --></a> Classes are identified
by name. Two classes with the same name may be different versions
or completely different classes that can be distinguished only by
comparing their interfaces or by comparing hashes of the
interfaces.</li>
<li><a name="a4605" id="a4605"><!-- --></a> Default serialization
will not perform any type conversions.</li>
<li><a name="a4606" id="a4606"><!-- --></a> The stream format only
needs to support a linear sequence of type changes, not arbitrary
branching of a type.</li>
</ul>
<hr size="8" width="35%" align="left" noshade="noshade" />
<h2><a name="a4602" id="a4602"><i>5.4</i> Who&#39;s Responsible for
Versioning of Streams</a></h2>
<a name="a4550" id="a4550"><!-- --></a> In the evolution of
classes, it is the responsibility of the evolved (later version)
class to maintain the contract established by the nonevolved class.
This takes two forms. First, the evolved class must not break the
existing assumptions about the interface provided by the original
version, so that the evolved class can be used in place of the
original. Secondly, when communicating with the original (or
previous) versions, the evolved class must provide sufficient and
equivalent information to allow the earlier version to continue to
satisfy the nonevolved contract.
<p><a name="a4613" id="a4613"><!-- --></a></p>
<p><img alt=
"Private serialization protocol and contract with supertype relationships between evolved and nonevolved classes and their instances"
align="middle" src="versiona.gif" /></p>
<p><a name="a4845" id="a4845"><!-- --></a> For the purposes of the
discussion here, each class implements and extends the interface or
contract defined by its supertype. New versions of a class, for
example <code>foo&#39;</code>, must continue to satisfy the
contract for <code>foo</code> and may extend the interface or
modify its implementation.</p>
<p><a name="a4675" id="a4675"><!-- --></a></p>
<p>Communication between objects via serialization is not part of
the contract defined by these interfaces. Serialization is a
private protocol between the implementations. It is the
responsibility of the implementations to communicate sufficiently
to allow each implementation to continue to satisfy the contract
expected by its clients.</p>
<hr size="8" width="35%" align="left" noshade="noshade" />
<h2><a name="a6519" id="a6519"><i>5.5</i> Compatible Java Type
Evolution</a></h2>
<a name="a6520" id="a6520"><!-- --></a> The Java Language
Specification discusses binary compatibility of Java classes as
those classes evolve. Most of the flexibility of binary
compatibility comes from the use of late binding of symbolic
references for the names of classes, interfaces, fields, methods,
and so on.
<p><a name="a6593" id="a6593"><!-- --></a></p>
<p>The following are the principle aspects of the design for
versioning of serialized object streams.</p>
<ul>
<li><a name="a5549" id="a5549"><!-- --></a> The default
serialization mechanism will use a symbolic model for binding the
fields in the stream to the fields in the corresponding class in
the virtual machine.</li>
<li><a name="a5550" id="a5550"><!-- --></a> Each class referenced
in the stream will uniquely identify itself, its supertype, and the
types and names of each serializable field written to the stream.
The fields are ordered with the primitive types first sorted by
field name, followed by the object fields sorted by field
name.</li>
<li><a name="a7102" id="a7102"><!-- --></a> Two types of data may
occur in the stream for each class: required data (corresponding
directly to the serializable fields of the object); and optional
data (consisting of an arbitrary sequence of primitives and
objects). The stream format defines how the required and optional
data occur in the stream so that the whole class, the required, or
the optional parts can be skipped if necessary.
<ul>
<li>The required data consists of the fields of the object in the
order defined by the class descriptor.</li>
<li>The optional data is written to the stream and does not
correspond directly to fields of the class. The class itself is
responsible for the length, types, and versioning of this optional
information.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a name="a7100" id="a7100"><!-- --></a> If defined for a class,
the <code>writeObject</code>/<code>readObject</code> methods
supersede the default mechanism to write/read the state of the
class. These methods write and read the optional data for a class.
The required data is written by calling
<code>defaultWriteObject</code> and read by calling
<code>defaultReadObject</code>.</li>
<li><a name="a5552" id="a5552"><!-- --></a> The stream format of
each class is identified by the use of a Stream Unique Identifier
(SUID). By default, this is the hash of the class. All later
versions of the class must declare the Stream Unique Identifier
(SUID) that they are compatible with. This guards against classes
with the same name that might inadvertently be identified as being
versions of a single class.</li>
<li><a name="a6676" id="a6676"><!-- --></a> Subtypes of
<code>ObjectOutputStream</code> and <code>ObjectInputStream</code>
may include their own information identifying the class using the
<code>annotateClass</code> method; for example,
<code>MarshalOutputStream</code> embeds the URL of the class.</li>
</ul>
<hr size="8" width="35%" align="left" noshade="noshade" />
<h2><a name="a6678" id="a6678"><i>5.6</i> Type Changes Affecting
Serialization</a></h2>
<a name="a5366" id="a5366"><!-- --></a> With these concepts, we can
now describe how the design will cope with the different cases of
an evolving class. The cases are described in terms of a stream
written by some version of a class. When the stream is read back by
the same version of the class, there is no loss of information or
functionality. The stream is the only source of information about
the original class. Its class descriptions, while a subset of the
original class description, are sufficient to match up the data in
the stream with the version of the class being reconstituted.
<p><a name="a6723" id="a6723"><!-- --></a> The descriptions are
from the perspective of the stream being read in order to
reconstitute either an earlier or later version of the class. In
the parlance of RPC systems, this is a &#34;receiver makes
right&#34; system. The writer writes its data in the most suitable
form and the receiver must interpret that information to extract
the parts it needs and to fill in the parts that are not
available.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h3><a name="a5172" id="a5172"><!-- --></a> <i>5.6.1</i>
Incompatible Changes</h3>
<a name="a6759" id="a6759"><!-- --></a>
<p>Incompatible changes to classes are those changes for which the
guarantee of interoperability cannot be maintained. The
incompatible changes that may occur while evolving a class are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a name="a6756" id="a6756"><!-- --></a> Deleting fields - If a
field is deleted in a class, the stream written will not contain
its value. When the stream is read by an earlier class, the value
of the field will be set to the default value because no value is
available in the stream. However, this default value may adversely
impair the ability of the earlier version to fulfill its
contract.</li>
<li><a name="a6780" id="a6780"><!-- --></a> Moving classes up or
down the hierarchy - This cannot be allowed since the data in the
stream appears in the wrong sequence.</li>
<li><a name="a6796" id="a6796"><!-- --></a> Changing a nonstatic
field to static or a nontransient field to transient - When relying
on default serialization, this change is equivalent to deleting a
field from the class. This version of the class will not write that
data to the stream, so it will not be available to be read by
earlier versions of the class. As when deleting a field, the field
of the earlier version will be initialized to the default value,
which can cause the class to fail in unexpected ways.</li>
<li><a name="a6821" id="a6821"><!-- --></a> Changing the declared
type of a primitive field - Each version of the class writes the
data with its declared type. Earlier versions of the class
attempting to read the field will fail because the type of the data
in the stream does not match the type of the field.</li>
<li><a name="a9542" id="a9542"><!-- --></a> Changing the
<code>writeObject</code> or <code>readObject</code> method so that
it no longer writes or reads the default field data or changing it
so that it attempts to write it or read it when the previous
version did not. The default field data must consistently either
appear or not appear in the stream.</li>
<li><a name="a9543" id="a9543"><!-- --></a> Changing a class from
<code>Serializable</code> to <code>Externalizable</code> or vice
versa is an incompatible change since the stream will contain data
that is incompatible with the implementation of the available
class.</li>
<li><a name="a9541" id="a9541"><!-- --></a> Changing a class from a
non-enum type to an enum type or vice versa since the stream will
contain data that is incompatible with the implementation of the
available class.</li>
<li><a name="a9352" id="a9352"><!-- --></a> Removing either
<code>Serializable</code> or <code>Externalizable</code> is an
incompatible change since when written it will no longer supply the
fields needed by older versions of the class.</li>
<li><a name="a9412" id="a9412"><!-- --></a> Adding the
<code>writeReplace</code> or <code>readResolve</code> method to a
class is incompatible if the behavior would produce an object that
is incompatible with any older version of the class.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<h3><a name="a6754" id="a6754"><!-- --></a> <i>5.6.2</i> Compatible
Changes</h3>
<a name="a6747" id="a6747"><!-- --></a>
<p>The compatible changes to a class are handled as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><a name="a5174" id="a5174"><!-- --></a> Adding fields - When
the class being reconstituted has a field that does not occur in
the stream, that field in the object will be initialized to the
default value for its type. If class-specific initialization is
needed, the class may provide a readObject method that can
initialize the field to nondefault values.</li>
<li><a name="a5523" id="a5523"><!-- --></a> Adding classes - The
stream will contain the type hierarchy of each object in the
stream. Comparing this hierarchy in the stream with the current
class can detect additional classes. Since there is no information
in the stream from which to initialize the object, the class&#39;s
fields will be initialized to the default values.</li>
<li><a name="a5524" id="a5524"><!-- --></a> Removing classes -
Comparing the class hierarchy in the stream with that of the
current class can detect that a class has been deleted. In this
case, the fields and objects corresponding to that class are read
from the stream. Primitive fields are discarded, but the objects
referenced by the deleted class are created, since they may be
referred to later in the stream. They will be garbage-collected
when the stream is garbage-collected or reset.</li>
<li><a name="a6785" id="a6785"><!-- --></a> Adding
<code>writeObject</code>/<code>readObject</code> methods - If the
version reading the stream has these methods then
<code>readObject</code> is expected, as usual, to read the required
data written to the stream by the default serialization. It should
call <code>defaultReadObject</code> first before reading any
optional data. The <code>writeObject</code> method is expected as
usual to call <code>defaultWriteObject</code> to write the required
data and then may write optional data.</li>
<li><a name="a6786" id="a6786"><!-- --></a> Removing
<code>writeObject</code>/<code>readObject</code> methods - If the
class reading the stream does not have these methods, the required
data will be read by default serialization, and the optional data
will be discarded.</li>
<li><a name="a5209" id="a5209"><!-- --></a> Adding
<code>java.io.Serializable</code> - This is equivalent to adding
types. There will be no values in the stream for this class so its
fields will be initialized to default values. The support for
subclassing nonserializable classes requires that the class&#39;s
supertype have a no-arg constructor and the class itself will be
initialized to default values. If the no-arg constructor is not
available, the <code>InvalidClassException</code> is thrown.</li>
<li><a name="a6837" id="a6837"><!-- --></a> Changing the access to
a field - The access modifiers public, package, protected, and
private have no effect on the ability of serialization to assign
values to the fields.</li>
<li><a name="a6838" id="a6838"><!-- --></a> Changing a field from
static to nonstatic or transient to nontransient - When relying on
default serialization to compute the serializable fields, this
change is equivalent to adding a field to the class. The new field
will be written to the stream but earlier classes will ignore the
value since serialization will not assign values to static or
transient fields.</li>
</ul>
